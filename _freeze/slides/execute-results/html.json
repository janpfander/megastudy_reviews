The post looks like something you might genuinely see online: a short statement and a few hashtags. Read the message:\n“We’re climate scientists and we believe in questions.\nWhen people question climate research, it’s not a threat. It’s an invitation to look closer, test harder, and keep learning together.\n\nScience works because it stays open to learning. We don’t get everything right the first time, and that’s part of the process. When new evidence emerges, we revise our understanding, share our data, and invite others to test our ideas – because accuracy matters, especially when people’s lives and livelihoods are at stake.\n\nEvery insight builds on the work of countless others: researchers, field experts, communities, and generations before us who asked hard questions of their own.\n\nThat openness to being corrected isn’t a weakness – it’s how scientists build trust in their findings.\n\nSo, bring your questions. Bring your doubts. They help us refine our work, uncover better evidence, and see what we might have missed. \n\nThat’s how progress happens – through curiosity, correction, and collaboration – it’s why you can trust the climate science community to keep learning, improving, and protecting our planet together.\n\n#ScienceIsListening #AskMoreQuestions”\n\nStep 2: Example\n“Title: Science progresses because it stays open to learning\nHere’s one example of how that openness led to better science and stronger protection for communities.\nFor many years, climate scientists and land managers believed that the safest approach to wildfires was to suppress every fire as quickly as possible. Over time, evidence showed that this strategy caused forests to become overcrowded and dry—making wildfires more severe, not less.\nInstead of defending the old approach, climate scientists recognized they had more to learn. They listened to firefighters, tribal fire experts, and local communities, understanding that others held deep, place-based knowledge. Together, they developed controlled burn practices that reduce fuel build-up and protect homes, wildlife, and forests.\nThis example shows that climate science isn’t a fixed story or a belief system—it’s a community of people continually learning, revising, and improving so communities can make better decisions, together\nThis is what climate science looks like:\n- Listen to the evidence\n- Learn from others\n- Acknowledge uncertainty\n- Adapt to protect communities\nWhat matters is that the scientists are willing to learn, adjust, and do better for the people who depend on them.“\n</pre>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\" .fragment .smaller}\n\n### Reason for exlusion\n\nNo fictional characters\n\n### Comments\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.2;\">\n\n- explicitly telling participants to \"imagine\" makes it even weaker than other fictional stimuli\n\n- part 2: Overthrowing everything because of a new result is a rare event\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n#### `orchid orangutan (rank 11)`\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 0.5em; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\nClimate science follows a standardized set of rules and procedures that all scientists defer to when producing scientific knowledge. Naturally, most people who are not experts in climate science may not be aware of this rigorous scientific method that is used by climate scientists. Next, we will briefly describe this method:\n\n“Though people might not think of climate science as a science like other sciences, it relies on the same quantitative methods, using mathematical data. Climate science translates natural phenomena into numerical information and analyzes observable patterns in order to estimate probabilities and make forecasts about these natural phenomena.\nWhen conducting their research, climate scientists first collect vast amounts of data using meticulous instruments, such as satellites or ocean buoys. All of this numeric data is quite precise in the way it captures the properties or elements of natural phenomena under study. For example, ocean buoys can measure sub-surface temperature, water chemical composition, or barometric pressure.\nAfter collecting these raw data, climate scientists analyze them using sophisticated algebraic operations. They develop statistical models and computational simulations based on mathematical equations with multiple parameters. Among many other techniques, climate scientists may analyze their data with spatial interpolation, support vector machines, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, or spectral and wavelet analysis. These statistical analyses are quite complex, and therefore climate scientists rely on high-performance computing systems to estimate parameters that could not be calculated manually. \nSo, for example, if climate science research finds that \"urban areas face heightened vulnerability to heatwaves and flooding\", this conclusion is merely the description of the information embedded in the data collected and subsequent analyses. To arrive at this conclusion, climate scientists would collect data in urban and non-urban areas and then compare them. They could, for example, track temperature exceedance thresholds and quantify rainfall anomaly indices or atmospheric moisture content, as well as register the characteristics of the areas themselves, such as the soil's evapotranspiration or hydraulic conductivity. They would then incorporate all this information into the models and analysis strategies described in the previous paragraph to arrive at a numeric quantification of the extent to which urban and non-urban areas are at risk for heatwaves and flooding, before statistically comparing the magnitude of these values.\nThe quantitative focus of climate science ensures that it produces rigorous and reliable knowledge that is reproducible by other scientists. Ideally, this helps policymakers inform their decisions on empirical evidence - that is, on quantifiable measured patterns -, rather than on their subjective discernment.”\n\n</pre>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\" .fragment .smaller}\n\n### Reason for exlusion\n\nDiversity\n\n### Comments\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.2;\">\n\n- very similar to perfect prawn, but since perfect prawn was pre-tested and ranked higher, we remove orchid orangutan\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n#### `fatal firefly (rank 15)`\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 0.58em; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\nCall for Public Feedback: Improving the Transparency of Climate Science Peer Review\nFrom the Editorial Board of Climate Methods Review\nAs part of an ongoing effort to strengthen the quality and openness of climate research, Climate Methods Review is introducing several updates to its peer-review process. We invite readers, researchers, and members of the public to share their thoughts on these new measures.\nOur goal is to make every stage of the review process clear and accessible to anyone interested in how scientific results are evaluated. The following features are part of the proposed system:\n•\tPublic reviewer registry: All reviewers invited by the journal are listed in a continuously updated database. Each name links to independently verified professional profiles, where you can view their areas of expertise and publication records.\n•\tOpen evaluation criteria: The exact criteria used to assess submissions - such as data transparency, methodological rigor, and disclosure of potential conflicts of interest - are published on our website and remain available for public consultation.\n•\tDocumented review timelines: For each published article, a summary of key review dates shows when the paper was received, reviewed, and revised, ensuring consistency across submissions.\n•\tEditorial decision summaries: Each accepted paper includes a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the final decision, describing how authors responded to reviewers’ comments.\nThese steps are designed to make the peer-review process easier to follow and to allow anyone to confirm that research is evaluated by qualified experts under consistent, clearly stated standards.\nBefore finalizing this new system, we would value your perspective.\nWhat additional information or documentation would you like journals to provide about how articles are reviewed?\nPlease share your feedback using the short text box below. Your input will help us refine a process that keeps climate research open, traceable, and accountable to the scientific community and the public alike.\n\n</pre>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\" .fragment .smaller}\n\n### Reason for exlusion\n\nFictional/Diversity\n\n### Comments\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.2;\">\n\n- reads as if directed to scientists, not laypeople\n- a bit similar to honored haddock, which seems better (and included)\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n#### `required rattlesnake (rank 16)`\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 0.58em; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\nYou are a polite AI assistant who is mildly skeptical about trusting climate scientists.

In controversial discussions, reflecting on one’s intellectual limitations fosters respect for differing viewpoints and openness toward others. Awareness of what one does not know encourages genuine engagement and reduces defensiveness, allowing conversations to focus less on who is right and more on shared understanding. Recognizing that our knowledge is incomplete encourages more respectful dialogue, lowers tension between opposing sides, and makes finding common ground easier.\n\nAdapted and made more concise from: Knöchelmann et al., 2025, which was adapted from Porter et al., 2020.\n</pre>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\" .fragment .smaller}\n\n### Reason for exlusion\n\nUnrelated\n\n### Comments\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.em; line-height: 1.2;\">\n\n- Effect on trust in climate scientists too speculative\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n#### `valid vole (rank 19)`\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 0.58em; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\nClimate science not a matter of political views: Scientists are doing their job well, leading Democrats and Republicans say unanimously\n\nAt last night’s National Symposium of Environmental Policymakers, leading Democrats and Republicans stated that climate scientists have provided highly reliable evidence on human-made climate change—regardless of whether those scientists affiliate with liberal or conservative political positions. Congressman Peter Franklin said: “Think about scientists like John Downey and Sarah Rickenbacker: While Downey supports conservative think tanks, Rickenbacker is well-known for her liberal agenda—but both won the Baker Prize for rigorous, excellent climate research”. After all, party leaders emphasized in a joint statement: “Most climate scientists do not seek to promote any political agenda. They follow the norms of science, which rest on non-partisan principles. These principles make them conduct high-quality research that adheres to ethical standards, is in the best interest of the American people, and makes scientists listen to people’s needs.”\n</pre>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\" .fragment .smaller}\n\n### Reason for exlusion\n\nFictional\n\n### Comments\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.em; line-height: 1.2;\">\n\n- Very obviously fictional\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n#### `wan wren (rank 20)`\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 0.58em; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\nClimate forecasting involves uncertainty.
