The research team has made preliminary decisions on which intervention proposals to select. We would like to give you the opportunity to challenge these decisions (or support them, if you agree). \n\nWe used the (standardized) aggregate scores from your individual reviews as a baseline: by default, the interventions that made it into the top 20 will be selected for testing. \n\nHowever, screening the reviews and the top 20, the research team has set additional inclusion criteria, which not all interventions in the top 20 met. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\nWe encourage you to raise concerns regarding our preliminary selection decisions.\n\nPlease use this [📄 google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RHu_dxYxn8zbfo1F3EAVPXYJ7eB6gA7ZeejHZwLXkv0/edit?tab=t.0) \n\nPlease also feel free to use the data explorer to see if there are other interventions that you would really like to see included (e.g. for reasons of diversity or novelty). If that is the case please send me an email (janlukas.pfaender@gmail.com).\n\nYou have time to provide feedback **until January 5, 2026**.\n\nThank you!!\n:::\n\n## Inclusion criteria\n\n1. No fictional characters\n\nSeveral interventions use fictional scientists, journals, or scientific communities. It is hard to anticipate if these interventions will become practically relevant. Further, they require that we debrief participants after the intervention, for ethical reasons. This is problematic for the follow-up study: we will likely not have persistent effects from fictional interventions, or worse, we might even find negative long-term effects if participants felt we were just making things up. \n\n2. Diversity \n\nIdeally, we want to test a wide range of different interventions. With similar interventions, we used two strategies to avoid redundancy: When there were complementary elements, we suggested merging (and we will offer co-authorship to all involved teams). When two interventions were essentially the same, we picked the one that was better ranked. \n  \n3. Major concerns on effectiveness\n\nWe suggest excluding one intervention, because we believe it is too unrelated to our outcome variable, trust in climate scientists. In another case, we justified exclusions with major concerns stated in one of the reviewer comments (but in this case, in addition, a similar and higher-ranked intervention was already included). \n\n## Selection\n\n@tbl-summary provides a summary, and @tbl-detail lists all decisions as proposed by the research team. These decisions are not final. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary table'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> decision </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> ✅ Keep </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 11 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> ✏️ Adapt </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 7 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> ❌ Remove </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 14 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 🔀 Merge </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-detail .cell tbl-cap='Detailed table with all decisions'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\n  .details-box, .detail-text {\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;

People often resist climate science not because they lack information, but because accepting climate science implies supporting policies they oppose. For example, Campbell and Kay (2014) demonstrate that individuals, especially conservatives, express doubt when solutions involve government regulation. Thus, distrust is affected by ideological threat rather than evidence.\\n\\nResearch shows that this threat is reduced when messages affirm core values. For example, Mason et al. (2024) show that framing climate action as patriotic and system-preserving increases belief in climate change. Similarly, Bain et al. (2012) find that linking climate action to economic development increases acceptance. Together, these studies suggest that climate skepticism decreases when climate information is presented in a way that affirms rather than challenges individuals’ worldview.\\n\\nOur intervention builds on these findings. Instead of appealing to environmental protection, morality, or urgency, the intervention highlights that profit-driven corporations and insurance companies rely on climate scientists’ work. Insurance companies use climate projections to price physical risk and decide which regions and sectors to insure. Because insurers lose money when they underestimate risk, they have a financial incentive to use only reliable, accurate information. Likewise, large corporations integrate climate projections into supply-chain decisions, site selection, and long-term planning. In recent years, many private-sector firms have recruited climate scientists to work in-house on risk modeling and financial planning.  Because climate science is politicized (Schrøder, 2023), showing that companies depend on climate scientists conveys a credibility signal that is not political.\\n\\nWhen an outside actor relies on experts, people infer competence and trust (Yuan et al., 2020). In this context, the private sector functions as an independent validator: their reliance signals competence and, by implication, integrity and openness. This approach is fully non-deceptive; it only reports how climate scientists’ work is currently used in real business decisions, and it is likely the strongest possible credibility cue for Republicans and Independents, since profit-driven organizations would not rely on climate scientists’ work unless it proved helpful.\\n\\nThe intervention is intentionally non-partisan. Instead, it frames climate scientists' expertise in the context of the private sector. This design should especially affect participants who are typically more hesitant to accept climate science (Campbell & Kay, 2014), as it removes an ideological threat. While the effect may be weaker among Democrats, based on theoretical assumptions, it is expected that trust will increase among Republicans and Independents.\\n\\nThe intervention is low-cost and easily scalable as the narrative can also be used in other formats (e.g., journalism) and does not rely on deception.\\n\\nWe ran a short pretest with 150 participants (75 with treatment and 75 in the control group) on Prolific. The pattern of results was in the expected direction for Independents and Republicans, although the test was underpowered and relied on 7-point scales (t(147.24) = 0.99, p = .32, 95% CI [−0.22, 0.65]).\\n\\nReferences\\nBain, P.

When people perceive scientists as belonging to an out-group rather than their own, scepticism toward their messages tends to increase, while trust declines. A recent meta-analysis (Fage-Butler, Ledderer, & Nielsen, 2022) shows that public scepticism arises when scientists are seen as having hidden motives rather than serving the public good, suggesting that mistrust reflects an in-group/out-group dynamic in which scientists are perceived as outsiders. \\n\\nAs a result, emphasizing that scientists serve the interests of ordinary people rather than those of distant elites may help strengthen public trust in science. The context of carbon inequality, defined by the disproportionate share of emissions produced by the wealthiest groups, offers a powerful opportunity to do so (Chancel, 2019). Carbon inequality makes visible who causes the most harm and who bears the consequences, revealing that the climate crisis is not equally shared but structurally driven by a small minority. However, public understanding of these inequalities remains distorted. Nielsen et al. (2024) and Köchling et al. (2025) find consistent misperceptions across countries including the United States, Denmark, Germany, Nigeria, and India: while people tend to estimate emissions from the lower half of the income distribution accurately or even overestimate them, they substantially underestimate those of the wealthiest groups. \\n\\nIn our intervention, tested for the first time, we use information about carbon inequality to reshape the relationship between scientists and the public by manipulating in-group and out-group dynamics. A total of 812 participants were recruited through Cloud Research Connect and randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the control condition, participants completed the 12-item trust in science scale that will also be used in the Megastudy. In the intervention condition, participants first viewed a short text accompanied by a carbon inequality chart, framing scientists as members of the public’s in-group, people who serve collective interests by exposing who pollutes, who profits, and who should contribute most to the transition. They then completed the same trust in science scale. Results show that this in-group framing intervention increased trust by approximately 3.5 percentage points compared to the control condition (M_control = 75.15, M_intervention = 77.87), t(810) = −2.00, p = .045, 95% CI [−5.40, −0.06].\\n\\nOur intervention is theoretically valuable because it bridges two previously separate areas: perceptions of inequality and trust in science. Although misperceptions of carbon inequality are well documented, little is known about how such information shapes perceptions of scientists or public trust. Our findings suggest that highlighting carbon inequality can strengthen trust in science. Practically, this approach is effective for three reasons. First, it directly counters climate misinformation by exposing who pollutes and who seeks to discredit science. Second, it shows that scientists work on behalf of people and justice rather than wealthy individuals. Finally, it is easily scalable, as organizations like Oxfam already communicate about carbon inequality and could readily integrate this framing.\\n\\nReferences:\\nChancel, L. (2022).

Intellectual humility involves recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge and being open to others’ perspectives (Porter et al., 2022). It has both intrapersonal aspects, such as awareness of one’s fallibility, and interpersonal aspects, such as respect for differing viewpoints, willingness to admit uncertainty and learn from new information. These qualities align closely with the norms of good scientific practice, where uncertainty and self-correction are essential for progress (Hoekstra & Vazire, 2021).\\nWhile scientists sometimes hesitate to express uncertainty publicly, fearing it may undermine credibility, empirical work suggests that communicating self-correction can enhance perceived trustworthiness, including perceived integrity, benevolence, and even expertise (Altenmüller et al., 2021; Hendriks et al., 2016). In the context of climate science, acknowledging complexity and uncertainty has also been linked to increased trust (Howe et al., 2019; Vaupotič et al., 2024).\\nKoetke et al. (2025) conducted four experimental studies, which showed that when scientists communicate with high intellectual humility (vs. low intellectual humility or control), U.S.-based participants reported higher trustworthiness (expertise, integrity, benevolence) as well as expressed stronger beliefs about scientist’s research. These effects were robust across the political spectrum and different scientific topics, including a sustainability-related one.\\nWe propose that explicitly communicating intellectual humility by a group of climate scientists, who acknowledge the limits of current knowledge, express openness to new evidence, and signal the collaborative nature of their work could increase perceived expertise, integrity, benevolence, and openness.\\nClimate scientists could incorporate humility-based communication in outreach activities or teaching. Such communication describes scientific practice as an evolving, self-correcting process, potentially strengthening public trust in climate scientists across the board due to low risk of backfire effects and strong alignment with scientific norms.\",\"This intervention addresses public skepticism about the integrity and motivations of climate scientists, specifically beliefs that scientists are financially motivated, politically biased, or part of an unaccountable elite. The intervention targets three recurrent claims found in conservative media and policy commentary: (1) that climate scientists profit from government action on climate change, (2) that climate research receives excessive public funding, and (3) that climate policies benefit elites while burdening ordinary people.\\nThe intervention draws on recent work conceptualizing climate politics as status politics (Wetts, 2025), which argues that opposition to climate action is partly rooted in symbolic struggles over the perceived authority of educated elites. Distrust of scientists is often less about specific empirical claims and more about perceived violations of fairness, integrity, and accountability. Accordingly, the intervention does not attempt to persuade through abstract facts alone but instead aligns climate science with widely shared moral values of transparency, fairness, and responsible stewardship of public funds.\\nParticipants first respond to a brief set of questions that prime shared values of fairness, honesty, and transparency in public institutions. These items focus on integrity in the use of taxpayer money, the importance of accurate information in policymaking, and the need for accountability among powerful actors. The goal of this value activation is to foreground moral principles that participants view as important and to provide a lens through which they interpret subsequent information about climate science.\\nParticipants are then presented with a series of short statements reflecting common misinformation claims about the motivations of climate scientists (e.g., “Climate scientists are paid to support certain climate policies”). After rating their agreement, participants receive factual corrections and context. Each correction includes clear, empirically grounded information about how climate research is funded, the modest median salaries of environmental scientists, the volunteer structure of major scientific assessments, and the transparency requirements for federal and university grants. The intervention clarifies that large dollar amounts associated with initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act or the NOAA’s budget do not reflect direct spending on climate research. Rather, climate research represents only a small portion of broader environmental and energy programs.\\nResearch in political psychology and misinformation correction suggests that value-consistent framing can reduce defensive processing and ideological resistance (Feinberg & Willer, 2013; Motta et al., 2021). By pairing a values affirmation with interactive fact-checking and emphasizing transparency and shared fairness norms, this intervention aims to reduce affective distrust toward climate scientists and reframe climate research as a public good rather than an elite project. This intervention could be adapted for public communication campaigns, journalism, and science education to rebuild trust in climate science institutions. By emphasizing transparency and moral accountability rather than technocratic authority, it provides a model for depolarizing science communication in contexts where distrust stems not from misunderstanding but from perceived moral and status violations.\\n\",\"Description\\nThis intervention portrays climate scientists collectively as intellectually humble and a group that recognizes uncertainty, acknowledges limits, and continually updates understanding in light of new evidence. Framed as a message from an international consortium of climate scientists, it emphasizes intellectual humility as a shared professional ethic rather than an individual personal trait. The intervention’s core narrative of “We’re learning more every day” signals openness, collaboration, and credibility on behalf of science as a whole. By emphasizing intellectual humility at the group level, it normalizes transparency and self-correction as defining features of the scientific process. By acknowledging uncertainty, learning openly, and inviting dialogue, this approach humanizes scientists, fosters identification (“people like us who keep learning”), and invites public collaboration rather than passive acceptance to leverage practical mechanisms that directly strengthen trust. \\n\\nBackground\\nRecent work has emphasized the importance of intellectual humility of scientists — openly acknowledging uncertainty, limitations, and ongoing debate (Hoekstra & Vazire, 2021). This has been supported by recent empirical evidence from a series of studies, which shows that perceived intellectual humility of scientists as a group correlates with greater trust in scientists overall, stronger belief in anthropogenic climate change, and greater support for evidence-based policies such as vaccination and genetic modification (Koetke et al., 2025). Furthermore, describing a specific scientist as high (versus low) in intellectual humility increased their perceived trustworthiness, belief in their research, and willingness to follow their recommendations, regardless of the scientist’s gender or race (Koetke et al., 2025).  Complementing these findings, other recent work shows that when scientists acknowledge the limits of their disciplinary perspective when communicating policy options, it can attenuate the political polarization of trust in scientists and scientific findings (Post & Bienzeisler, 2024). Together, this evidence underscores the potential value of testing generalisable humility-based communication interventions in the climate science domain, where trust remains especially polarized.\\nAccordingly, our intervention aims to increase perceived intellectual humility of scientists by emphasizing that changing in light of new evidence is intrinsic to scientific progress, and that collaboration and credit-sharing are central to how science advances. The intervention is theoretically grounded in the Ability–Benevolence–Integrity (ABI) model of trust (Mayer et al., 1995). Intellectual humility can strengthen all three dimensions simultaneously: it enhances ability through signalling mastery of the scientific method through transparent acknowledgement of uncertainty, benevolence by shifting perceptions from elitist to collaborative, and integrity through openness about limits and evolving evidence.\\n\\nPractical application: \\nThe framing is conceptually powerful yet logistically simple. It can be deployed through existing communication channels, including press releases, interviews, educational campaigns, or social media statements from established climate science organizations. It offers a low-cost, high-impact way to strengthen trust in science at scale, making it both theoretically grounded and practically executable.\\nKoetke, J., Schumann, K., Bowes, S.

These endorsements may serve as trust bridges, helping skeptical audiences view climate science as objective and reliable rather than politically motivated. \\n\\nTheoretical basis: \\nIn the context of climate science, most people cannot directly evaluate complex models or datasets. Instead, they can look for costly signals that others have already vetted the evidence. When actors such as insurance firms, reinsurance companies, or long-term investors integrate climate projections into billion-dollar decisions, they send a signal: they are staking material resources on the accuracy of the science.\\nPersuasion depends on both the perceived expertise and the trustworthiness of the communicator (Source Credibility Theory; Hovland & Weiss, 1952). Climate scientists are seen as highly expert, yet their trustworthiness can be undermined by polarized media framing that paints them as politically motivated. Conversely, entities like insurers, central banks, or defense agencies are trusted precisely because they are viewed as apolitical and financially cautious. When such actors rely on climate data to inform billion-dollar decisions, they effectively lend “borrowed credibility” to climate scientists, validating their work from an unexpected and trusted quarter.\\nThis mechanism also draws on Signaling Theory (Spence, 1973): actors who commit substantial resources based on climate models demonstrate belief in their validity. The costly nature of such signals e.g., insurers pricing in sea-level risk, communicates sincerity more powerfully than verbal advocacy. Recipients interpret these signals as independent verification of climate scientists’ accuracy and objectivity.\\n\\nPrior evidence:\\nTrust in climate science does not arise from scientists alone but from a broader ecosystem of communicators. Cologna et al. (2024) show that while climate scientists are generally trusted, they are not the most trusted sources among all audiences, particularly among politically conservative groups, who express greater trust in figures like primary-care doctors and television weather forecasters. Scientists are “just one component in a larger communication ecosystem”.\\nSimilarly, Varda et al. (2024) argue that sustaining trust in science depends on a network of “stewards of trust” including policymakers, journalists, and civic institutions who collectively reinforce scientific credibility. Their study finds that participants value endorsement from independent actors on scientific findings, emphasizing that no single voice can maintain public confidence in science.\\n\\nPractical application: \\nThe intervention can be deployed by adapting authentic statements from insurers, defense agencies, or financial regulators. These messages already exist in public reports, press releases, and news coverage, making content generation inexpensive and automated. Brief narrative or headline-style messages (e.g., “Global insurer adjusts premiums based on climate projections”) can be integrated into educational materials, fact-checking platforms, or climate information portals. Because the approach works through exposure to credible, apolitical actors rather than persuasion from climate scientists themselves, it can be repeated across diverse contexts without message fatigue. This makes it suitable for wide, low-cost rollout through social media ads, government communication campaigns, or collaborations with journalists and industry partners.\\n\\nReferences:\\nCologna, V., Kotcher, J., Mede, N.

We believe this increase in trust will occur due to correction of misperceptions regarding climate scientists.\\n\\nAttacking experts through character assassination is a key aspect of climate obstructionism commonly used by contrarians to undermine scientists and policymakers (Coan et al., 2021). Such attacks can be particularly damaging when aimed at scientists’ competence or integrity (Barnes et al., 2018). We aim to help restore this trust in climate scientists by exposing the documented history of deliberate disinformation and deception by the fossil fuel industry, including their attempts to discredit climate scientists. There has been limited exploration of discrediting misinformation sources in climate communication, despite fossil fuel companies’ documented history of deliberate deception (Franta, 2021; Merner et al., 2025; Supran & Oreskes, 2017). Fossil fuel companies were a key part of climate research in the 1950s-80s (Franta, 2018; Brulle et al., 2019) with scientists at one company predicting global warming with high levels of skill and accuracy (Supran et al., 2023). Starting in the late 1980s, however, the fossil fuel industry devised a public relations campaign to stop action on climate change. The result was two decades of propaganda perpetuated by fossil fuel interests and their third party allies, which entailed denying climate science and slandering climate scientists (e.g., Cook et al., 2019; Oreskes & Conway, 2011). \\n\\nPublic opinion data suggest that exposing fossil fuel deception increases support for accountability, with surveys by Data for Progress (2023), Center for Climate Integrity (2023), and Hart Research (2016) showing consistent belief shifts after participants learn of the companies’ historical deception. These findings indicate public receptivity to source-based framing, in contrast to the dearth of media coverage that the fossil fuel industry’s history of malfeasance has received (Hertsgaard, 2021; Kalhoefer, 2015). We believe that this exposure of fossil fuel deception - particularly the slander of climate scientists - has the potential to increase trust in climate scientists by correcting misperceptions surrounding these scientists.\\n\\nIn our intervention, we explicitly refute and elaborate (Kendeou & O’Brien, 2014; Kendeou, 2024) on the role of fossil fuel companies in slandering climate scientists. We highlight fossil fuel companies’ violations of dimensions of perceived trustworthiness (Besley et al., 2021) such as their dishonesty (integrity), concealment of research (openness), funding false experts (competence), and profit-seeking over public welfare (benevolence). In turn, we aim to increase perceptions of climate scientists’ integrity and competence by refuting claims of scientists’ research misconduct and lack of expertise as well as inoculate against the strategies used by climate obstructionists.\\n\\nSuch an intervention could be deployed in real-world settings such as refutational social media videos, news articles, documentaries, and other public engagement efforts concerning the history of fossil fuel deception. Insights from our work might also help inform effective climate communication more broadly - for example, by scientific organizations, nonprofits, and policymakers.\",\"Pfänder and Mercier have developed a theoretical account that seeks to explain why people trust science even though they have very little science knowledge. In this rational impression account, people are impressed by scientific discoveries, which leads them to trust scientists, but then they quickly forget the knowledge that had impressed them. The rational impression account is grounded in cognitive science studies that have shown: \\n\\n(i)\\tThat people are good at identifying impressive knowledge (things that few people know) and that they deem people who have such knowledge more competent (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976251339633)\\n(ii)\\tThat people tend to think that consensual information (such as well-established scientific discoveries) is accurate, and the people who generated the information are competent (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027724002919) \\n(iii)\\tThat people remember well gist memories (e.g. whether someone is competent), while they tend to forget the verbatim information that led to that gist (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1041608095900314)\\n\\nThe account and its empirical backing are described in this pre-print: https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/nwka2_v1.\\n\\nThe effect of impressive science has been directly tested in the cases of archeology and entomology: providing participants with impressive discoveries in these fields made participants more likely to think of archeologists and entomologists (respectively) as competent and trustworthy (in press, see https://osf.io/preprints/osf/argq5_v2). Moreover, participants promptly forgot almost all of the information they had found impressive. Although there is no formal recipe for generating impressive information, manipulation checks have shown that the texts meant to be impressive were indeed deemed to be impressive.\\n\\nWe have recently conducted a pilot experiment applying the same method to climate scientists. Texts highlighting climate scientists’ range of activities and discoveries, the difficulty of their task, and their past successes have led to much higher levels of trust in climate scientists, with overall increases of approximately 12 points (out of a 100) on each of the four broad measures of trust (competence, benevolence, integrity and openness) (by comparison with a text unrelated to climate science). More specifically, a text designed to be very impressive had similar effects than a text that was more descriptive, but which turned out to have also been deemed very impressive. Both texts were non-significantly more effective than a text designed to elicit gratitude towards climate scientists. The results can be found at this link https://janpfander.github.io/impressive_climate/ \\n\\nIf the suggested intervention is successful, it could be applied in real world settings for instance by suggesting that journalists and science communicators spend more time communicating about the actual science of climate science—how climate scientists understand, measure and predict the climate—instead of mostly its consequences for the world or for policy.\",\"Leveraging “unconventional climate advocates” to enhance trust in climate scientists\\n\\nTheoretical foundation\\nPublic acceptance of climate science depends not only on what is communicated but also on who communicates it. Social identity and value‐aligned communication theories suggest that when climate messages threaten people’s political or cultural identities, defensiveness rises and trust declines (Fielding et al., 2020). Conversely, messengers who embody shared values and ingroup identities can bridge divides and foster openness toward scientific information (Fielding & Hornsey, 2016; Hornsey & Fielding, 2017).\\n\\nBuilding on this principle, the emerging concept of “unconventional climate advocates”, such as farmers, military veterans, and religious leaders, highlights the persuasive potential of advocates who promote climate action from social identities not typically associated with climate issues (Colvin et al., 2025; Gulliver et al., 2025). Conventional environmentalist-identified advocates may be less trusted by some social groups like political conservatives (Ghasemi et al., 2025). By signaling shared identities and values, unconventional advocates may help sidestep partisan divides and frame climate science through more resonant frames. In doing so, the credibility attributed to these trusted ingroup messengers may extend to climate scientists who become viewed as partners rather than outsiders.\\n\\nWhy unconventional advocates are promising\\nEmpirical research supports the power of value-congruent and identity-consistent communication to increase trust and belief acceptance. Messages affirming conservative values of stewardship, loyalty, and responsibility enhance acceptance of climate science (Dixon et al., 2017), while faith-based framing activates moral and communal values that strengthen engagement (Goldberg et al., 2019). Unconventional advocates naturally embody these values. Military messengers, for example, have been shown to increase receptivity to climate information among right-leaning respondents (Motta et al., 2021), while “conservative conservationists” reconcile identity conflicts by reframing climate concern as moral duty rather than political allegiance (Diamond, 2024). Media analyses similarly find that unconventional advocates are perceived as more credible and less radical than conventional environmental NGOs (Gulliver et al., 2025). Collectively, this suggests a trust spillover effect, where credibility attributed to unconventional advocates may transfer to climate scientists.\\n\\nOur preregistered experiment (https://osf.io/p5ztq/overview?view_only=883f5907fe1c425a906362383e150911, manuscript in preparation) provides further supporting evidence. Rural and regional Australian participants exposed to information about unconventional advocates (e.g., Farmers for Climate Action, Australian Firefighters Climate Alliance, Australian Religious Response to Climate Change) reported higher climate concern, perceived responsibility, dynamic norms, and policy support than those shown conventional advocates (e.g., Greenpeace Australia Pacific and general climate advocacy groups); these effects were stronger among climate-skeptical and right-leaning participants.\\n\\nProposed intervention and real-world implications\\nThe intervention will present short vignettes randomly featuring a farmer, military veteran, or religious leader expressing climate opinion in value-congruent language as manipulation material (see below) for unconventional advocates. This approach aligns with existing initiatives such as the U.S. Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance, military climate networks, and the Catholic Climate Covenant. Demonstrating that such interventions can enhance trust in climate scientists highlights the potential of partnerships with unconventional advocates as climate messengers: an identity-bridging strategy that is theoretically grounded, empirically supported, and scalable for strengthening public engagement with climate science.\",\"Theoretical motivation\\nThe lack of public trust in climate scientists stems from a perceived deficit in integrity, competence, and benevolence (1). Ideologies further predispose people to distrust climate scientists, making skepticism normative within like-minded groups (2). For this reason, traditional social norm interventions – highlighting what others do and think in a static manner – often fail to shift climate beliefs or spur action (3).  \\n\\nThe emergent concept of dynamic norms, however, provides a promising alternative to enhance trust in climate scientists. Rather than statically describing ‘what others do and think’, dynamic norms emphasise change – how public attitudes or behaviours have evolved over time. Perceiving such change triggers two cognitive processes: anticipating a different future and assigning greater relevance to the behaviour (4). Together, these processes foster attitudinal and behavioural change. \\n\\nThe intervention draws on shifts in public sentiment toward climate scientists’ integrity and competence, as evidenced by two PEW Research Centre surveys (5,6). Findings from these surveys show that the proportion of U.S. citizens who strongly trust climate scientists to provide accurate information about climate change increased from 39% in 2016 to 54% in 2022. Theoretically, trusting somebody to give accurate information reflects perceptions of that person’s competence (are they able to provide accurate information?) and integrity (will they tell the truth?). By making participants aware of this positive trend, our intervention leverages dynamic norm mechanisms and aims to strengthen trust in climate scientists.\\n\\n\\nWhy the intervention is effective \\nPrevious research provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of dynamic norm interventions across countries; even beyond traditional normative interventions (3,4). By showing participants a trend of growing trust in climate scientists, they are likely to (a) anticipate a future where such trust is the norm and (b) perceive higher trust in climate scientists no longer as impossible, but as achievable and important. This perceptual shift is likely to increase personal trust in climate scientists. \\n\\nHow it could be applied in real-world settings\\nOur intervention can be applied across all climate communication settings – from reports and media outlets to public speeches and social media. Because it draws on real-world data, it also tests the persuasive power of ‘actual research’ to increase trust in climate scientists. \\n\\n\\nReferences\\n1.\\tMayer RC, Davis JH, Schoorman FD.

This intervention is based on previous research that stresses the impact of certain beliefs about scientific disciplines on laypeople's trust in them. Laypeople display a bias or preference for numeric information and visual depictions of numeric data, even when this information is irrelevant (Eriksson, 2012; Godau et al., 2016; Newman & Scholl, 2012). People have greater respect for, and trust in, sciences that are perceived as being number/math-oriented, which makes them feel more precise (Broomell & Kane, 2017; Pfänder & Mercier, 2025). In previous research by our group (under review), we provide further evidence for this: a) when the public organizes sciences in their mind, they do so based on whether the discipline is more or less quantitative, and b) the more quantitative a discipline is, the more scientists working in that discipline are perceived as capable, benevolent, and honest (which in turn fuels public support for funding that discipline). While the public certainly recognizes the reliance on quantitative methods by climate scientists (our data shows that, in general, natural sciences are thought about that way; see also e.g., Gligoric et al., 2022), this association may not come spontaneously to mind when people think about climate science and climate scientists. Rather, people may focus on their beliefs that climate scientists are biased and self-interested in pushing a certain political agenda instead (Cologna et al., 2024). The goal of this intervention is to turn people's attention to a characteristic of climate science (i.e., being a quantitative discipline) that is associated with higher trust in scientists. We believe that this intervention would work exactly because previous work (our research; Broomell & Kane, 2017) has already established that perceiving a discipline as more quantitative increases support for science and trust in it. To bolster the potential of this intervention, the concrete materials additionally include statistical jargon, which is functionally similar to how numerical information has been used in previous research (see Eriksson, 2012). Jargon has been shown to increase satisfaction with explanations and ascriptions of expertise to scientists (Cruz & Lombrozo, 2025). Furthermore, this is a relatively minimal intervention that can be deployed in many contexts. For example: Scientists can stress that their findings are based on quantitative methods and data when interacting with skeptical audiences, in order to increase perceptions of their expertise. In fact, our data show exactly that this number-orientation dimension is particularly apt at changing the beliefs of those who are more skeptical of science (and climate science in particular) -- conservative individuals -- probably because perceiving a discipline as quantitative increases perceptions of its certainty (to which this group is particularly sensitive; Broomell & Kane, 2017). This intervention is scalable and can be used as a way for science communicators to establish their credentials based on empirically-validated dimensions that have been shown to foster trust in scientists (and in its many sub-facets, concretely).\",\"\\\"What type of climate scientist are you?\\\" This interactive \\\"personality quiz\\\" asks participants to answer scenario-based questions requiring decisions similar to those faced by climate scientists (e.g., handling uncertainty, responding to criticism, managing funding conflicts). Each scenario presents four response options reflecting trustworthiness dimensions. Participants receive a personalised profile (e.g., \\\"The Transparent Communicator,\\\" \\\"The Rigorous Sceptic\\\") highlighting shared values with climate scientists. This intervention builds on three theoretical cornerstones:\\nSocial Identity Theory & Common Ingroup Identity Model (Tajfel & Turner, 1979, 1986; Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000): \\nThe quiz facilitates recategorisation by transforming perceptions from \\\"us vs. them\\\" to an inclusive \\\"we\\\" (Gaertner et al., 1993). By discovering shared values with climate scientists, participants develop a common ingroup identity, for example, as \\\"people who value rigorous thinking.\\\" This recategorisation reduces intergroup bias and increases trust (Dovidio et al., 1998), serving as social identity affirmation that improves perceptions of scientists (Nauroth et al., 2015).\\n\\nPerspective Taking & Self-Other Overlap (Galinsky et al., 2005; Batson et al., 1997):\\nScenario-based questions prompt participants to adopt the perspectives of climate scientists. Perspective-taking increases self-other overlap, i.e., the mental merging of self and other (Davis et al., 1996), generating empathy and prosocial motivation. Self-other overlap mediates the relationship between perspective-taking and empathy (Cialdini et al., 1997; Myers & Hodges, 2012), potentially enhancing perceived benevolence and openness.\\n\\nImagined Intergroup Contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009; Turner et al., 2007): \\nThe quiz simulates mental contact through role-taking scenarios. A meta-analysis of over 70 studies found imagined contact reduces intergroup bias (d+ = 0.35) across attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behaviour (Miles & Crisp, 2014), mediated by reduced anxiety and increased trust (Turner et al., 2010).\\nImplementation: Participants encounter 6 scenarios covering key trustworthiness dimensions, for example: \\n\\nIntegrity: “You find an error in your published study. What do you do?” \\nOpenness: “Someone criticises your research online. How do you respond?” \\nBenevolence: “Policymakers ask if they should implement climate action. What do you say?” \\nCompetence: “Your data shows a trend but isn't 100% certain. How do you proceed?” \\n\\nEach response is scored on the underlying dimensions. The quiz should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Participants then receive one pre-written profile that (1) names their “scientist-type”, (2) describes demonstrated values, (3) explains how climate scientists embody these values, (4) uses affirming language emphasising commonalities, and (5) optionally includes a real climate scientist example to enhance personification. \\n\\nThis intervention targets all outcome dimensions, especially integrity, benevolence, and openness. By creating identification through shared values discovery, the quiz should enhance trustworthiness perceptions and function similarly to cooperative quiz games that reduced partisan animosity (Woodley et al., 2025). The non-threatening format should avoid reactance while facilitating perspective-taking and fostering a common identity. Effects should persist as participants internalise commonalities as self-generated insights. Furthermore, this intervention has a low threshold for user-centred interactions, as it can be easily applied to real-world applications - for example, as an AR filter on social platforms like TikTok or an interactive online quiz.\",\"This intervention draws on the principles of social proof and expertise as key mechanisms for building trust. According to social influence theory (Kelman, 1953), people tend to adopt beliefs or attitudes that are endorsed by credible others, especially recognized experts. Research consistently shows that consensus among experts increases perceived accuracy and reliability of scientific claims (Lewandowsky et al., 2013). Empirical evidence suggests that emphasizing the expert consensus on climate change significantly increases belief in climate science and support for climate policy (van der Linden et al., 2016).\\n\\nHowever, many people remain unaware of how scientific peer review actually works. Peer review aims to be a clear and credible signal of both expertise and accountability, as it demonstrates that climate research is scrutinized by independent specialists before being accepted. Making this process salient should increase perceived credibility of climate scientists, as it frames their claims as products of collective expert review rather than individual opinion. The intervention also addresses another common source of distrust: the misconception that climate scientists act in isolation or are driven by personal or political motives. By foregrounding the collaborative and self-correcting nature of peer review, it highlights that trust in climate science is trust in a transparent, expert-driven process, not in individual personalities. At the same time, however, highlighting the rigorous peer review process of climate science also reinforces perceptions of individual-level researchers' competence.\\n\\nThis intervention could be implemented in public communication campaigns, educational settings, and news media to increase understanding of how scientific credibility is established. For example, short explainer posts, museum exhibits, or infographics could present how climate studies undergo rigorous peer review before publication. Media outlets could reference this process when covering new climate findings to reinforce trust. In digital contexts, platforms that share scientific information, such as social media pages of research institutions or research journalist outlets could use similar messaging to emphasize the expert assessments underlying climate research.\\nBy making the peer review process visible and relatable, this intervention aims to strengthen the perception that climate science is trustworthy because it is based on systematic expert evaluation, not individual belief. This framing aligns with decades of research showing that perceived scientific consensus and procedural transparency are among the most effective predictors of public trust in science.\",\"Description\\nThe intervention aims to create a perception of scientists as in-group members who are community-minded and share values with ordinary citizens. By shifting perceptions of climate scientists from “outsiders with an agenda” to “community members working for shared goals”, the intervention activates a sense of common values and shared purpose and could reduce the psychological distance between climate scientists and the public. Participants are shown a brief, text-and-image module, highlighting climate scientists working alongside local residents—such as farmers, firefighters, and emergency planners—to protect homes, land, and community safety. The examples portray scientists as community members who work together with the local population to protect it and care about the same priorities as everyone else: family, home, preparedness, and stewardship of local environments. Finally, participants are asked to reflect on ways scientific work has benefited their own community, encouraging internalization without persuasion. The goal is to shift perceptions of climate scientists from distant or ideological to familiar, collaborative, and prosocial.\\n\\nTheoretical reasoning\\nDrawing on the Common Ingroup Identity Model (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), this intervention aims to frame scientists as part of the same in-group by highlighting shared values (family, work, community safety, and stewardship) and presenting them as relatable, benevolent, and community-oriented individuals. It has been argued that appeals to broadly shared values could increase trustworthiness perception of scientists (Cologna et al. 2024). \\nA set of correlational and experimental studies has further shown that perceived prosocial motives of scientists are linked to higher trust (Benson-Greenwald et al., 2021), thus emphasizing that scientists are community-oriented and care for the greater good could also be a promising strategy in the climate domain. Another mechanism through which this intervention has the potential to be effective is humanization, which may address the perception of scientists as distant or impersonal by emphasizing warmth – an essential dimension of trust (Fiske & Dupree, 2014; Philip-Muller et al, 2022).\\n\\nReal-world applicability\\nThis intervention could be used by public libraries, science museums, universities, and local emergency preparedness programs to build trust in climate science by highlighting shared values and community collaboration. It is also well-suited for social media platforms (e.g., Facebook pages, local government Instagram accounts, YouTube explainers, or short TikTok/Reels videos). Because the intervention focuses on scientists' prosocial motives and role as fellow community members, rather than climate messaging or persuasion, it can be adopted in rural, suburban, and urban outreach contexts to strengthen trust in science across diverse audiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\nBenson-Greenwald, T.

An innovative line of work in communication theory and epistemology proposes an alternative model: trustless communication. Rather than seeking to increase trust through moral or emotional appeal, trustless communication aims to reduce the need for trust by designing interactions and systems that are verifiable, transparent, and procedurally accountable. This approach builds on the idea that reliance can be established through visible mechanisms of scrutiny, analogous to “trustless” systems in computer science and blockchain governance, where cooperation is ensured through decentralization, risk reduction, and confidence-maximizing rules rather than faith in individual actors.\\nThe current intervention is among the first empirical tests of this emerging theoretical framework. It examines whether trustless communication strategies, by demonstrating that scientific processes or scientists themselves are not demanding trust but instead enabling verification, can nonetheless produce higher measured trust in climate scientists. In other words, the intervention investigates whether making trust unnecessary also makes it easier.\\nIn both proposed versions, the message replaces affective appeals (“trust us, we are experts”) with risk-reducing and certainty-maximizing procedural or informational transparency (“you can verify our expertise and review criteria yourself”). One version focuses on trustless process: it is presented as an actual call by a hypothetical climate science journal inviting public feedback on its peer-review procedures, while describing how reviewer lists, qualifications, evaluation criteria, and decision timelines are made publicly accessible. Ideally, this could be modeled on a real scientific journal. The second version focuses on trustless individuals, where a collective of climate scientists calls for public feedback on their planned study, detailing their research plan and demonstrating that their funding sources, data, and peer-review histories are openly documented and verifiable. In both cases, the core mechanism is not persuasion through authority but confidence through inspectability.\\nWe expect that this trustless strategy will increase perceived competence, expertise, and openness, while also signaling benevolence indirectly through a willingness to be held accountable. Although the trustless framework is designed to function without requiring interpersonal or institutional trust, it acknowledges that trust may nonetheless be advanced through it — specifically by satisfying the same psychological needs for predictability and control that underlie trust judgments (Mayer et al., 1995; Lewicki et al., 2006).\\nBeyond theoretical novelty, this approach is highly applicable to real-world climate science communication. Scientific institutions, journals, and data repositories increasingly face public demands for transparency and accountability. Implementing verifiable disclosure mechanisms - such as open peer-review ledgers or public researcher registries - could strengthen confidence in science without relying on contested narratives about scientists’ intentions or moral integrity.\",\"The intervention puts participants in an unexpected role: convincing a skeptical Large Language Model (LLM) to trust climate scientists. Participants engage in a brief, live text-based conversation with an LLM embedded in the survey. The LLM begins mildly skeptical about climate scientists and asks the participant to explain why they should be trusted. Over the course of 2–3 brief exchanges, the participant responds to polite yet critical questions. In the final message, the LLM acknowledges that the participant's arguments were convincing. The task lasts less than five minutes and does not store participants' typed responses. The purpose is engagement and self-persuasion, not response analysis.\\nCrucially, participants aren't asked to state false beliefs or pretend to be skeptics themselves. Instead, they adopt a discussion position (like in a debate club) where they advocate for trusting climate scientists, regardless of their personal views. This framing lets participants engage intellectually with the arguments without requiring them to misrepresent their own stance.\\n\\nBackground\\nThis intervention draws on self-persuasion theory (Aronson, 1999), which shows that creating arguments in support of a position strengthens the speaker's own attitudes. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) explains the underlying mechanism: by actively generating arguments to convince a skeptical AI, participants engage in central-route processing. The debate task creates high motivation through personal relevance and advocacy, while the structured exchanges provide sufficient cognitive ability to process arguments systematically. This deep elaboration may promote increased trust in climate scientists.\\nFurther, the LLM's mild skepticism introduces a controlled challenge, applying Inoculation Theory (Compton, 2025). Exposure to weak counterarguments, followed by successful refutation, increases resistance to future persuasion attempts against trusting climate scientists. By recalling prior knowledge to construct arguments (Gurlitt & Renkl, 2010), participants activate and strengthen existing mental associations with climate science credibility.\\nThe live conversational format simulates a dialogue that promotes active recall, encourages elaboration, and helps participants integrate climate science knowledge into coherent, persuasive reasoning.\\n\\nImplementation\\nThe LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude) is embedded in Qualtrics via a custom HTML/JavaScript chat interface that connects to the model through a secure proxy server.\\nThe conversation runs live inside the survey, with the system prompt controlling tone and content to ensure mild skepticism, openness to persuasion, factual accuracy, and avoidance of offensive material. No participant messages are stored. Interaction is capped at 2-3 exchanges to keep duration within five minutes, after which the LLM provides a positive closing message reflecting that it has been convinced.\\n\\nSummary\\nThis intervention uses a live, interactive LLM to elicit active persuasion from participants. By convincing a skeptical but responsive AI, participants engage in deeper cognitive processing, rehearsing and consolidating reasons for trusting climate scientists, which theory predicts will strengthen trust attitudes in a lasting way. This intervention is highly scalable and could be integrated into educational settings such as online courses or climate literacy modules, where students consolidate their understanding through active argumentation, or deployed in public engagement campaigns on climate organization websites and social media platforms. System prompt below.\",\"Intellectual humility is a metacognitive ability that allows people to recognize the fallibility of their knowledge (Krumrei-Manusco & Rouse, 2016). It also enables people to own up to these limitations and seek to update their knowledge base (Leary et al., 2017; Whitcomb et al., 2017). Intellectually has been associated with a wide range of cognitive and social outcomes including reduced dogmatism, increased open-minded thinking, increased perspective-taking, and enhanced compromise-seeking behaviors (Porter et al., 2022). Of particular relevance to this proposal, recent works have found that intellectually humble people tend to have more trust in science and scientists, and tend to be less skeptical of climate change (Huynh et al., 2025; Ploh & Musil, 2023). However, no work has examined whether an intellectual humility intervention can increase trust in climate scientists specifically. \\n\\nRecently, Knöchelmann and colleagues (2025) conducted an intervention tournament pitting five intellectual humility interventions against each other (explanatory depth, growth mindset, a humility information text, listing unknowns, and self-distancing). They found that providing a text about the benefits of intellectual humility for improving conversations over different political topics was most effective at enhancing intellectual humility across the different controversial topics examined. This finding extends previous work on the effectiveness of this intervention for improving people’s efforts for mastery-focused learning (Porter et al., 2020). Critically for this proposal, this intervention has been demonstrated to be effective in short, online-based studies (i.e., taking less than 2 minutes to complete). \\n\\nThis is a relatively straightforward and simple intervention with huge upside potential for application in real-world settings. For example, relatively simple reminders about the benefits of intellectual humility prior to engaging with climate scientists and climate research can help increase trust in the researchers and their research. For instance, this text could be posted on websites and media where people go to get information about climate science. \\n\\nAll in all, given intellectual humility’s ability to predict increased trust in science/scientists and decreased trust in climate skepticism this validated intervention has high potential to be an effective strategy for increasing trust in climate scientists. \\n\",\"Former climate skeptics should play a much larger role in strategic communication efforts to increase trust in climate scientists. This proposal adapts insights from our previous research to offer new climate communication solutions to declining trust in climate scientists; \\\"reversal narrative messaging.\\\" \\n\\nReversal narratives tell the stories of people who once held positions at odds with scientific consensus, but opted to change their minds. In theory, these messages work by establishing trust between messengers and skeptical audiences. Psychologically, people tend to place higher levels of trust in messengers who share their views, which (in a source credibility framework) in turn increases receptivity to persuasive messaging attempts [1-2]. \\n\\nOur past research provides an evidentiary basis for the effectiveness of reversal narrative messaging. For example, in both controlled experiments and quasi-experimental settings, we found that former vaccine skeptics who regret not vaccinating (e.g., due to getting seriously sick) can significantly increase vaccination intentions in vaccine hesitant subpopulations. [3-4]\\n\\nHowever, efforts to apply reversal narrative messaging to climate change contexts -- and trust in climate scientists in particular -- are lacking. While our previous research has explored the impact of related counter-stereotypical climate messaging on ACC acceptance (e.g., when groups with climate-denying reputations make pro-ACC arguments) [5], we are unaware of previous efforts to employ the \\\"skeptics who saw the light\\\" strategy to promote trust in climate scientists. \\n\\nReversal narrative messaging in climate contexts could take the form of highlighting the stories of people who have lost their homes due to extreme weather events, experienced negative health outcomes associated with increasing average global temperatures, and much more. Unfortunately, real-world accounts of stories like this are plentiful. \\n\\nIn this submission, I propose to randomly assign survey respondents to read a true and lightly edited story (involving NO deception) about a former climate skeptic -- Meteorologist Jennifer Rukavina, from Kentucky. The passage (<200 words) details how a the meterologist (a self-identified Republican) did not like what she saw as \\\"political theatre\\\" around climate science. However, she decided that she would not \\\"let politics dictate what is good science.\\\" She changed her mind about climate change after \\\"hearing from scientists themselves,\\\" and uses her new perspective to take an active role in preparing her community for \\\"the challenges that lie ahead.\\\" \\n\\nThis manipulation does not involve deception (it is a lightly edited news interview), and should in theory increase multiple domains of trust: as the story draws on themes related to benevolence (using climate science to protect Rukavina's community), openness (as Rukavina is a former skeptic), and competence (Rukavina is herself a meteorologist). \\n\\nThis study should also be sufficiently powered to detect experimental effects. Our previous reversal narrative work typically recovers effects of about 12 percentage points; which a study of this size can detect with power levels exceeding 90%. While I expect the reversal narrative message to have population-wide effects, a N = 1,000 should also be sufficiently large to study partisan asymmetries in message acceptance.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

AUTHOR (BLINDED)\\n5. AUTHOR (BLINDED)\",\"Research has shown that people’s trust in science rests on their belief that they have the same political worldviews as scientists (1). Particularly for issues such as climate change, which is increasingly linked to sociopolitical identity questions about air travel or meat consumption, a perceived mismatch of people’s and scientists’ political ideologies is a main driver of low public trust in scientists (2). This is especially salient in the US, where two major parties offer conflicting answers to these questions, contributing to what has been conceptualized as “affective climate polarization” (3). Affective climate polarization conceives “climate attitudes as expressions of social identity and group affiliation” and has arguably deepened a cleavage between segments of the population with high and low trust in climate science, with cleavage edges mapping well onto Democrat vs. Republican partisan agendas (4).\\n\\nA promising lever to maintain public trust in climate scientists across the entire population is therefore to reduce affective climate polarization. This necessitates a depoliticization of climate science, so as to decouple public perceptions of scientists from political ideology. However, there is no work that translates this rationale into an actionable climate depoliticization intervention. We propose such an intervention that features the following key elements described in the conceptual literature on depoliticization and depolarization (e.g., 5–7). The intervention contains (a) bipartisan source cues, (b) quotes by opinion leaders, (c) references to the non-political norms of science, (d) mentions of non-partisan quality indicators, e.g. academic awards, and (e) focus on multiple dimensions of trust, e.g., competence, benevolence, integrity, and openness. \\n\\nThe proposed text-based vignette (first draft) combines these elements in a brief news article. It may help recipients perceive climate science as a non-partisan endeavor, where scientists’ expertise, benevolence, integrity, and openness are not contingent upon their perceived political orientation. If successful, it can inform science communication efforts (e.g., solutions-based science journalism) and political communication (e.g., campaigns bridging partisan gaps). Overall, this intervention lives up to recent calls for more inclusive and equitable science communication that benefits the entire population, as it seeks to foster trust across all groups of the public and not only the distrustful.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n1.

This message addresses this challenge by redefining what good science looks like and positioning scientists as the solution to reducing uncertainty. \\nLike the previous intervention, this message acknowledges uncertainty upfront and materializes the benefits of transparency through concrete actions: “share their methods publicly, invite peer review.” However, it employs two additional mechanisms.\\nFirst, the message reframes uncertainty as a positive professional norm. Rather than treating uncertainty as a red flag that undermines scientists' credibility, the message explicitly recasts it as “how good science works” and links it to “integrity and rigor.” This norm reframing changes how audiences interpret scientist behavior. Instead of viewing uncertainty acknowledgment as evidence of incompetence or deception, the message establishes a new evaluative standard: good scientists should admit uncertainty because that's what the scientific method requires. The phrase “share their methods publicly, invite peer review” reinforces that openness about uncertainty is the professional norm in science, not an exception or failure. Research on scientific norms shows that when audiences understand transparency and peer review as standard scientific practices, they interpret uncertainty acknowledgment more favorably (Merton, 1973; Anderson et al., 2010).\\nSecond, the message signals competence by positioning scientists as the solution to reduce uncertainty. The phrases “update their forecasts as new data emerges” and “willingness to refine their work” followed by “helps reduce uncertainty and gets us closer to the reality” create a clear progression: scientists identify uncertainty, then actively work to close the gap toward truth. This framing accomplishes two things. It signals that science is a learning process rather than a static body of facts, the only reliable path to reality. More importantly, it establishes expert researchers as essential guides who possess the skills and methods to reduce this uncertainty over time. By emphasizing what scientists do to address uncertainty (measure it, update forecasts, refine methods), the message demonstrates active competence. \\nThis framework works especially well when explaining why forecasts change or when addressing skepticism about scientific consensus shifts. It's valuable in science education to establish correct expectations about how knowledge develops, and in policy communications when explaining model updates. Science organizations can use this message to train researchers to frame uncertainty acknowledgment as professional duty while emphasizing their unique capability to reduce that uncertainty through systematic methods. By positioning scientists as both honest about current limits and uniquely equipped to overcome them, the message transforms uncertainty from a credibility liability into an opportunity to demonstrate both integrity and problem-solving competence.\\n\",\"This intervention uses a prediction–correction format to strengthen trust in climate scientists by helping participants actively engage with scientific consensus and the process that produces it. Participants estimate what percentage of scientists agree with several factual statements—three representing high consensus (“Human activities are the primary cause of global warming,” “Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet”, “Smoking causes lung cancer) and one reflecting ongoing scientific refinement (“Doubling atmospheric CO₂ will warm Earth by 3 °C”). After each estimate, participants receive immediate corrective feedback summarizing the actual level of expert agreement and explaining how those conclusions arise from multiple, independent lines of evidence.\\nThe design integrates three well-supported psychological mechanisms: \\n1) Prediction–Correction Learning. Having participants generate an estimate before revealing the correct answer increases cognitive engagement and facilitates belief updating (Kornell et al., 2009; Metcalfe & Finn, 2012). Active prediction prompts deeper processing and reduces defensiveness when presented with corrective feedback (Ecker et al., 2017; Guess et al., 2020). \\n2)  Communicating high expert agreement increases acceptance of scientific conclusions by signaling competence and evidential strength (Lewandowsky et al., 2013; van der Linden et al., 2015). Trust in climate scientists depends strongly on perceived consensus and legitimacy, which this intervention makes salient through repeated, quantified exposure to expert agreement. \\n3) Transparency About Uncertainty. The inclusion of a partially uncertain item demonstrates the integrity of scientific inquiry. Howe and colleagues (2019) show that transparently communicating uncertainty increases trust in scientists and message acceptance. This intervention thus reframes uncertainty as evidence of rigor and openness, not weakness.\\nTogether, these elements address both cognitive and affective bases of trust: competence (scientists know what they are doing), integrity (scientists are honest about limits), and warmth or benevolence (scientists work transparently in the public interest).\\nTheoretical and Empirical Value\\nThis intervention builds on prior work in science communication by embedding consensus information within an active prediction–correction framework that simultaneously highlights the transparency and self-correcting nature of science. Rather than simply presenting facts, participants actively test their assumptions against empirical reality, experiencing firsthand how scientific agreement and uncertainty coexist. By combining this prediction–correction format with clear information about expert agreement, it leverages evidence that perceived scientific consensus is causally linked to acceptance of climate science. Finally, by including a partially uncertain item, the intervention applies findings that transparently communicating uncertainty increases trust in scientists and message acceptance. Together, these mechanisms provide a concise, theory-driven test of how active learning, consensus perception, and transparent uncertainty can jointly strengthen trust in climate scientists.\\nReal-World Applications\\nThe format is brief, text-only, and scalable across online, classroom, and media contexts. Governments, museums, and educational platforms could adapt it as an interactive “Guess the Consensus” feature, allowing the public to test their intuitions about scientific agreement across topics. Beyond climate change, the same framework can correct misperceptions and strengthen trust in science on issues such as vaccine safety, air pollution, or nutrition research—where understanding both consensus and uncertainty is key to informed public decision-making.\",\"This intervention tests whether a brief, empathetic, text-based conversation with a large language model (LLM) can increase trust in climate scientists by addressing participants’ self-expressed reasons for skepticism. The idea builds on research showing that conversational engagement—especially when it invites self-reflection and affirms autonomy—can reduce defensiveness and improve receptivity to scientific information (Voelkel et al., 2024, Science; Abdel-Aal et al., 2024, Science).\\n\\nTheoretical motivation\\nMany individuals distrust climate scientists not because they reject science per se, but because they feel unheard or perceive bias in the scientific community. Motivated reasoning and self-affirmation theories suggest that perceived threat to identity or worldview reduces openness to corrective information. Providing a psychologically safe opportunity for participants to articulate their concerns before receiving balanced, respectful feedback can lower this threat.\\n\\nProcedure\\nParticipants are first asked to briefly list one or two reasons why some people (or they themselves) might not fully trust climate scientists. After typing their response, they are presented with a short, text-only conversation with an LLM chatbot embedded in the survey.\\n\\nThe chatbot (using pre-defined prompts, no adaptive fine-tuning) performs three actions:\\n\\nAcknowledges the participant’s concern respectfully (“That’s a reasonable question; many people wonder about this”).\\nResponds with accurate information addressing the concern (e.g., transparency of funding, replication, open data).\\nConcludes reflectively, highlighting shared goals between scientists and the public (“Building trust is a two-way process, and scientists aim for openness and honesty”).\\n\\nThe total duration is under five minutes. The dialogue content will be fixed and identical in structure for all participants, with wording varying only if the concern mentions partisan or identity-relevant cues (e.g., providing examples of scientists from the participant’s political ingroup).\\n\\nWhy this may be effective\\nEvidence from recent megastudies and conversational experiments shows that personalized yet non-argumentative interactions can reduce polarization and increase trust (Abdel-Aal et al., 2024; Bruneau & Saucier, 2022). This design extends those findings to the domain of climate science. By letting participants articulate their reasoning first, the intervention activates self-generated cognition rather than passive exposure—an approach known to foster attitude updating and durable belief change.\\n\\nReal-world applicability\\nIf effective, this approach could be scaled easily in online communication campaigns by universities, science communicators, or governmental agencies. Chatbots using transparent, pre-approved scripts could engage with skeptical audiences at minimal cost, offering personalized yet factual dialogue at scale. \\n\\n\\nVoelkel, J. G., Stagnaro, M.

Physicists, chemists, and biologists tend to be highly trusted, whereas climate scientists are considered less trustworthy by the general public (Gligorić et al., 2024). This is notable since the vast majority of the scientists who study the Earth’s climate system have a disciplinary background in the natural sciences, most commonly in atmospheric physics, geochemistry, oceanography, and biology. Here, we argue that messages that describe the field of climate science and explicitly mention natural science disciplines that contribute to this research field could have the potential to increase public trust in climate science.\\n\\nScientific disciplines can be considered as attitude objects, just like political parties, candidates, or issues. When two attitude objects are considered simultaneously, this can give rise to contrast or assimilation effects (Herr et al., 1983). Assimilation effects tend to emerge when two attitude objects seem to belong to the same category or are perceived as being closely related (Bless & Burger, 2016). The information that is made accessible through the confrontation with one attitude object (prime) is then used to form a mental representation of the second attitude object (target) (e.g., inclusion/exclusion model, Schwarz & Bless, 1992). \\n\\nWhen messages highlight the natural science disciplines that contribute to climate science, an assimilation effect could emerge: the attributes that laypeople commonly associate with the natural sciences, for example high competence and assertiveness (Gligorić et al., 2024), are then also associated with climate science. As a result, climate scientists may then seem more competent and assertive. These are crucial facets of trust (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995). It could therefore be assumed that exposure to messages that describe the field of climate science and highlight natural science disciplines that contribute to this research field may change how climate science is perceived. \\n\\nThis intervention can be implemented in the form of a short text. The text briefly describes the field of climate science, focusing on aspects such as research objectives and methods used in this field. Importantly, the text emphasizes that the scientists who are studying the Earth’s climate system are primarily natural scientists with backgrounds in atmospheric physics, geochemistry, oceanography, or biology. Several leading climate scientists are mentioned in the text. Their disciplinary background is made salient (e.g., “physicist James Skea”, “geoscientist Katherine Calvin”, “geochemist William Schlesinger”). It is also explained that climate models incorporate general physical and chemical principles in order to simulate climatic processes. This underscores the foundational role of the traditional natural sciences in climate research. \\n\\nIf this simple intervention proves successful, the practical implications could be considerable. Science communicators may then be encouraged to highlight the natural science disciplines that contribute to climate science whenever they discuss insights from climate research in public settings. \\n\\nReferences:\\nGligorić, V., Van Kleef, G.

This and other related work suggests that even strongly held attitudes can respond to facts and evidence, when people get the right facts and evidence. Based on this evidence, we expect that attitudes towards science and scientists will be similar responsive to LLM dialgoues. A pilot we conducted found a ~30 point increase in trust in scientist (on a 0-100 scale) among those who initially distrusted scientists. This approach could be applied in the world by creating a public-facing chatbot and using social media/google ads to drive traffic to the website; and by creating social media bot accounts powered by the underlying LLM that interact with people on social media expressing distrust in science and scientists.\",\"Climate scientists are often perceived by the public as elitist and socially distant (Mede & Schäfer, 2020). The belief that scientists are fundamentally different from “people like me” can undermine trust, particularly among groups already skeptical of scientific authority (Gligorić et al., 2025). Social identity theory and research on intergroup perceptions suggest that trust in experts increases when those experts are perceived as members of one’s ingroup or as psychologically close (Tajfel & Turner, 1986; Nauroth et al., 2016). Even minimal cues of similarity can increase warmth and perceived benevolence, and thereby potentially increasing perceived competence (Fiske et al., 2007). Experimental evidence demonstrates that portraying scientists as relatable rather than elite increases trust (Beauchamp et al., 2022).\\n\\nWe propose a “Relatable Scientist Mapping” intervention in which participants read a short profile of a climate scientist whose background cues are tailored to reflect aspects of the participant’s own background. Using demographic information already collected (region, age group, education, and political orientation), the profile presents the scientist as sharing everyday experiences and values with the participant. For instance, a participant from the Midwest will read about a scientist who grew up in the Midwest, while a participant in their 20s will encounter a scientist early in their career. This subtle identity alignment might reduce perceived distance and increases ingroup overlap.\\n \\nThe recategorization approach aims to increase trust by enhancing warmth-related trustworthiness dimensions and reducing perceptions that climate scientists belong to a distant elite. Competence may increase indirectly as warmth facilitates positive global impressions (Fiske et al., 2007).\\n\\nThe intervention uses broad, non-sensitive demographic mapping, does not involve deception, and mirrors naturally occurring forms of science communication (e.g., podcast interviews). If effective, this simple narrative technique provides a scalable, realistic tool for science communication: presenting climate scientists as ordinary community members who happen to study climate, rather than as remote experts. Highlighting relatable identities and values may offer a promising path to strengthening trust in climate science.\",\"Many interventions focus on the use of direct persuasion techniques (i.e., providing people with information about the risks and consequences of a certain behaviour/cognition; e.g., Glock, Müller, & Krolak-Schwerdt, 2013). Direct persuasion however can result in defensive responses, which diminish the success of a possible intervention (e.g., Liberman & Chaiken, 1992). Prevailing theories indicate that information against behaviours or cognitions can be overtly confrontational and give people the impression that their 'freedom to choose' is threatened, which leads to the experience of psychological reactance, and can even increase the behaviour or cognition at question (Brehm & Sensenig, 1966; Grandpre, Alvaro, Burgoon, Miller, & Hall, 2003). Researchers have found that compared with passively accepting a persuasive message, self-persuasion (i.e., generating own arguments against a behaviour/cognition by answering questions) is a far more effective method for changing smoking behaviour and decreasing smokers' defensive responses towards persuasive messages (e. g., Glock et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020; Loman et al., 2018). Thereby, generating few arguments seems to be more effective than generating many arguments (Müller, et al., 2017). To be specific, self-persuasion increases people's self-referential processes, they come up with arguments important to themselves, and change not only their attitudes towards a topic, but also more importantly change behaviour. It is thus an intervention which can be tailored to people as they provide the persuasive message themselves. By doing so, resistance can be avoided as the freedom to choose is not threatened. I think in your context, it is theoretically valuable to include as not much is known about how effective self-persuasion is when the topic is less important to people. Above mentioned studies mainly focussed on relevant topics (i.e., smoking and drinking behaviour, or healthy eating). Trust in scientists might be less obviously relevant to participants. \\nMy proposed intervention is thus to simply ask participants what valid reasons they have to trust climate scientists and write up the three most compelling arguments for them to do so vs. think about the question and answer it in one’s head without writing it up. Ideally, in a control condition would also write up arguments about a certain/related topic. But often, participants in the control condition read information (as this is what is normally done in real-life). \\nSuch an intervention is also easily applicable: messages to trust scientists could be formulated as questions. Receivers think about the message even if not writing up an answer (Li et al., 2020).\\n\\n\\n\",\"The intervention targets root causes of mistrust, such as political polarization, perceived agenda-driven science, and institutional distrust by presenting a local and non-politicized story of a real scientist whose work clearly benefits farmers, landowners, and towns. By using a story instead of statistics, we are leveraging the power of narratives. Participants first encode Adrienne as competent, aligned with conservative values (stewardship, economic security, self-reliance), before learning she is a climate scientist. This reveal encourages reappraisal of climate scientists (“people like this are climate scientists”) without triggering reactance or partisan cues. For our intervention, we specifically picked someone that matches the majority demographic of our participant sample to create a sense of ingroup similarity, which prior research shows can enhance perceptions of trust and credibility. We also mentioned working alongside different levels of government to improve the lives of citizens, with the goal of correcting misperceptions that climate science is driven by the agenda of specific industries and political groups. We expect this to increase perceived competence, integrity, benevolence, and openness of climate scientists as a group.\",\"The climatological knowledge we rely on today is far from new—it builds on hundreds of years of meticulous observation, experimentation, and analysis. In recent years, science communicators have repeatedly made references to the long history of climate research. On social media sites, photographs of old newspaper articles have been circulating that show that scientists had already identified human-caused global warming as a potential threat in the early 1900s. Here, we argue that highlighting the historical foundations of climate research could be an effective strategy to increase trust in climate science, particularly among conservative audiences. \\n\\nPsychological research has shown that people exhibit a tendency to associate longevity with goodness and validity (longevity heuristic; Eidelman et al., 2010). This tendency has been documented in numerous experimental studies and across various domains, from attitudes towards medical treatments to aesthetic judgments of art (e.g., Eidelman et al., 2010; Eidelman & Crandall, 2012). Shedding light on the long history of climate science could therefore change how this discipline is perceived. When people learn that major insights from climate science date back hundreds of years and have stood the test of time, this could make the discipline seem more trustworthy. \\n\\nThis effect could be particularly strong for conservatives. Studies show that conservatives are more likely than liberals to use longevity as an indicator for goodness and validity (e.g., Blanchar & Eidelman, 2021). Conservatives tend to prefer the past over the present; they are more nostalgic and less open to new ideas (e.g., Lammers & Baldwin, 2018). The notion of ‘traditional science’, conducted by academic pioneers in laboratories with analog instruments, may thus be particularly appealing to conservatives. Furthermore, highlighting the long history of climate science can help to clarify that climate change is not a concept that emerged in today's polarized political climate. This could make it more difficult to dismiss climate change as a \\\"hoax\\\" or \\\"political propaganda”. \\n\\nIt could therefore be helpful to communicate that the foundations of modern climate research were already laid hundreds of years ago. This information can be conveyed through a short text. The text provides a brief overview of the history of climate science, highlighting important milestones in the field. The text stresses that climate research dates back a long time, with some groundbreaking discoveries being made more than 150 years ago. For example, it is mentioned that the natural greenhouse effect was already discovered in the mid-19th century. The text describes how these past discoveries are still relevant today, to illustrate that key insights from this field have stood the test of time. Readers are presented with several images that make the text more engaging. Portraits are shown of pioneers of climate research such as John Tyndall and Guy Callendar. In addition, readers may be presented with newspaper headlines from the early 1900s which show that scientists have already been aware of the possibility of human-caused climate change at that time. \\n\\nThis intervention can be used in educational settings (e.g., school textbooks, museum exhibits, science centers/ columns). \\n\\nReferences:\\nEidelman, S., Pattershall, J., & Crandall, C.

We draw on evidence that trust in expertise of an agent is a function of the quality of past advice received from that agent (e.g., Twyman et al., 2008). In the case of climate scientists, we suspect that a key indicator of quality of past advice is the accuracy of climate models in prediction of future changes in the climate. Indeed, the perceived low accuracy of the data and computer models used by climate scientists has been shown to relate to poorer trust in climate scientists. This finding was observed in interviews with climate sceptics in the US (Sarathchandra & Haltinner, 2020), analyses of blog posts (Matthews, 2015), or a correlational survey in Australia (Tranter et al., 2023). \\n\\nThe proposed intervention entails asking the participants to read an adapted version of a real news article from Science attempting to answer the question of how well climate models as old as from the 1970s were able to predict actual development of the climate thereafter (Cornwall, 2019). If such early and simple models were accurate, this should serve as an important and easy-to-understand indicator of the quality of the underlying competence of climate scientists. Indeed, the article reports a study finding that the predictions of aggregate temperature changes were largely accurate both in direction and quantity. We adapted the article for easier comprehension and greater disclosure of uncertainty, an important principle of evidence communication (Blastland et al., 2020), acknowledging that while the accuracy of aggregate temperature changes are high, some models were also somewhat off and other changes such as exact locations and intensities of consequences of climate change are more difficult to predict. Communicating uncertainty was previously shown to enhance trust, for instance in the context of Covid-19 vaccinations (Petersen et al., 2021), a similarly polarized topic.\\n\\nWe expect that the short version of this intervention, i.e., simply stating that “even 50-year-old climate models correctly predicted global warming” may be an effective and easy to implement for climate communicators both in written and spoken format as a quick and simple potential way of raising the credibility of climate scientists. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBlastland, M., Freeman, A.

This is particularly salient when headlines highlight alarming projections—like record-breaking sea-level rise by mid-century—before later articles revising the numbers downward, or even reversing the direction, as new evidence emerges. This pattern, though reflecting the natural self-correcting process of science, can make the public perceive scientists as inconsistent, unreliable, or politically motivated. The proposed intervention addresses this trust gap by promoting epistemic humility as one cornerstone of credible science communication. It reframes humility not as hesitation or weakness, but as an honest acknowledgment that knowledge evolves—a signal that scientists are transparent, rigorous, and trustworthy precisely because they admit the limits of current understanding.\\nResearch on intellectual and epistemic humility suggests that individuals who openly recognize the provisional nature of their beliefs are perceived as more competent, sincere, and trustworthy (Porter & Schumann, 2018; Krumrei-Mancuso & Newman, 2020). In the domain of science communication, humility predicts greater perceived integrity and benevolence, especially when scientists explain why evidence sometimes changes (Koete et al., 2025; Steijaert et al., 2021). Studies on trust in science show that some people value honesty and openness even more than confidence when evaluating scientific credibility (Fiske & Dupree, 2014; van der Bles et al., 2019). Rather than eroding confidence, expressions of humility can strengthen perceptions of scientists’ methodological rigor and transparency—two central dimensions of trust.\\nThe intervention consists of a short, two-minute text designed to highlight epistemic humility in science and aims to acknowledge ongoing learning in the field. Participants will read a headline such as: “Why good scientists never claim to have the final word” followed by a body of text for the article such as: “Science moves forward by testing, refining, and sometimes revising what we know. When climate scientists say that their understanding has changed—perhaps updating how fast the ice will melt or how much temperatures might rise—that’s not a failure. It’s how reliable knowledge grows. Good science says: here’s what we do know (e.g., humans are warming the planet), and here’s what we are still exploring (e.g., exact slopes and timelines). Generally, scientists are open about the limits of their knowledge but are committed to refining it as new data emerges. That clarity and willingness to say ‘we don’t fully know yet’ signals transparency, honesty, and competence—rather than hiding messy unknowns. So next time you hear or read about uncertainty or changing predictions, remember: it means the science is working, not failing.”\\nThis approach is particularly relevant in an era of rapidly evolving climate findings, where changing projections can be misrepresented as evidence of deception or political bias. By normalizing epistemic humility as one tone of credible science, this brief text intervention helps recalibrate public expectations: trustworthy science isn’t unchanging—it’s self-correcting. By embedding epistemic humility into how scientific communication is framed, it offers a realistic, psychologically informed path toward restoring and sustaining trust in climate scientists.\",\"This intervention examines whether transparency about scientists’ underlying values can strengthen public trust in climate science. Climate change has become highly politicized and polarized in public discourse. At the same time, debates continue within scientific communities about scientists’ appropriate roles in society, particularly regarding advocacy and objectivity. While some maintain that science communication should remain “neutral” and value-free, scholars in philosophy of science argue that social, political, and ethical values inevitably shape how research is conducted and shared. The issue, therefore, is not whether values are present, but how they are communicated. \\n\\nRecent work suggests that when scientists explicitly disclose the values that guide their research, it may foster transparency and allow audiences to evaluate scientific claims more thoughtfully (van Eck et al., 2024). However, empirical findings remain mixed. Some studies indicate that value disclosures can undermine credibility when scientists’ values appear political or misaligned with the audience (Elliot, 2022). In contrast, other research finds that communicating scientists' care for public health can increase perceived trustworthiness (Hicks & Lobato, 2022). This indicates a need to clarify which kinds of value disclosures are most effective. \\n\\nThis intervention tests whether disclosing widely shared prosocial values, such as prioritizing social safety and protecting public health, increases trust in climate scientists. Participants will read a short statement from an interview with a “typical climate scientist.” In the experimental condition, the scientist communicates both their research findings and the values that motivate their work. In the control condition, the scientist communicates the same scientific information without stating personal values. \\n\\nIf value disclosure is effective, we expect increases primarily in perceived integrity, benevolence, and openness, dimensions shown to underpin trust in science. The intervention is highly applicable to real-world science communication settings such as public talks, interviews, and institutional messaging, where small adjustments in messaging may positively affect public trust. This study contributes to ongoing research investigating how transparent, prosocial value communication may help sustain trust in science.\\n\\n  \\nReferences\\nElliott, Kevin C., Aaron M.

Ideological divides further fuel distrust by framing the issue as “us” versus “them” (2) with each side perceived to hold opposing values (3). Consequently, interventions that merely aim to reduce psychological distance between groups (4) or rely on static social norms have had limited success (5). \\n\\nOur intervention takes a novel approach to enhancing trust in climate scientists by integrating theories of dynamic norms (6) and in-group favouritism (2). It reshapes perceptions of climate scientists’ moral values as centred on families, communities, and the economy. Dynamic norms operate by highlighting how public attitudes evolve over time, triggering two cognitive processes: (a) anticipating a future where such values are integral to the climate change agenda and (b) reconsidering past value-based barriers to change. Aligning climate scientists’ values with those of the in-group alleviates intergroup threat and helps to dissolve perceived divides (7).  \\n\\nWhy the intervention is effective \\nOur intervention is effective because it frames climate scientists as politically and morally aligned with the in-group. Prior studies (8,9) shows that such alignment reduces intergroup barriers and fosters more favourable climate attitudes. Concurrently, it presents climate scientists as benevolent and competent – core components of trust. The dynamic-norm element further encourages participants to anticipate (and desire) a future where their values guide climate science, reinforcing perceptions of value-alignment.\\n\\nHow it could be applied in real-world settings\\nThis intervention can be applied in media campaigns, educational programmes, and public outreach by framing climate scientists as sharing common values with ‘normal’ Americans. By emphasising evolving social norms and moral alignment, it builds trust and reduces ideological divides in real-world communication. \\n\\n1.\\tMayer RC, Davis JH, Schoorman FD.

A perceived political liberal bias can partly explain this lower level of trust in climate scientists among conservatives, as climate scientists are perceived as among the most liberal scientists (Altenmüller et al., 2024).\\n\\nImportantly, conservatives do not show equally low trust toward all scientists. Recent evidence from the US suggests that conservatives report the highest levels of trust in mathematicians, zoologists, and marine biologists (Gligorić et al., 2025), likely because scientists in these fields are perceived as being more politically moderate (Altenmüller et al., 2024).\\n\\nBuilding on this research, the proposed intervention aims to test whether trust in scientists from other fields can be leveraged to boost trust in climate scientists. Specifically, it focuses on the higher levels of trust conservatives express toward certain types of scientists. Participants will be exposed to information on interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and scientists from fields typically more trusted by conservatives, including mathematicians, zoologists, and marine biologists. The intervention will be a short text. \\n\\nWhile the intervention primarily targets conservative participants, it is very likely that it also will lead to higher trust among liberal participants, given that liberals tend to report high levels of trust in scientists across all fields (Gligorić et al., 2025). However, the way in which the intervention might strengthen trust in climate scientists may differ between conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nFor conservatives, the intervention could reduce the perception that climate scientists belong to a political outgroup (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), as the interdisciplinary collaborations highlight scientists who are not only part of the perceived outgroup but may also belong to, or align with, the ingroup. For liberals, on the other hand, who often prioritize climate issues very highly (e.g., Cole et al., 2025), learning that climate scientists collaborate with researchers from other fields (demonstrating commitment to addressing the climate crisis) is likely to further increase their trust in climate scientists.\\n\\nI believe that if this intervention proves effective, it could have practical applications. It could, for instance, increase motivation to communicate more actively about the interdisciplinary research currently being conducted in relation to climate science. Moreover, it might encourage researchers themselves to place greater priority on engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations.\",\"Catastrophes like the July 2025 Central Texas floods have once again reminded the world that climate change yields highly proximate risks across the globe. Yet, despite such visible consequences, research continues to identify strong patterns of motivated skepticism and distrust toward climate scientists, particularly among conservatives. Conservative individuals tend to be skeptical toward the existence of climate change (Egan & Mullin, 2017), the policies proposed to address it (Campbell & Kay, 2014), and the scientists researching it (Druckman et al., 2024). Some scholars even propose conservatives as the primary target group for decreasing distrust toward climate scientists (Remsö et al., 2025).\\nA promising approach to counter such motivated skepticism stems from construal level theory, which posits that individuals think about events or objects at varying levels of abstraction (Keller et al., 2022). When people perceive an issue as psychologically distant – spatially, temporally, socially, or hypothetically – they tend to engage in more abstract reasoning, often reinforcing prior ideological beliefs. Conversely, decreasing psychological distance has been shown to foster engagement and reduce defensive reasoning. Recent research demonstrates that informing individuals about the proximate, personally relevant risks of climate change can bridge partisan divides and strengthen belief in climate-related facts (Chu & Yang, 2018; Jones et al., 2017; Vlasceanu et al., 2024).\\nBuilding on these findings, we propose an intervention that makes both climate change and the work of climate scientists psychologically proximate. The treatment will present narratives that showcase how scientists’ efforts directly protect individuals and communities from immediate threats – for instance, through early-warning systems for floods, wildfire-risk modeling, or blizzard forecasting. By mapping participants’ demographic information, most importantly their state of residence, we can tailor the scenario to a locally salient hazard. Participants from flood-prone areas might read about scientists whose forecasts saved families from flash floods, those in fire-prone regions might encounter scientists preventing catastrophic wildfires, while respondents in colder climates could read about forecasters who helped cities prepare for deadly blizzards.\\nWe predict that reducing psychological distance in this locally adapted way will diminish motivated skepticism and increase trust in climate scientists. Two core trust dimensions should be particularly affected. First, portraying scientists as preventing risks for individuals should enhance perceived Benevolence – showing them as considerate, caring, and motivated to improve others’ wellbeing. Second, demonstrating the proximate usefulness of their work should heighten perceived Integrity, signaling honesty, ethicality, and sincerity. Together, these shifts are expected to foster higher overall trust and reduce ideological polarization in perceptions of scientists’ credibility.\\nWhile proximizing risk has proven effective for climate-belief interventions (Vlasceanu, 2024), extending this logic to strengthen trust in climate scientists themselves remains a novel approach. Its real-world applicability is substantial: localized media coverage or public communication that portrays scientists as guardians against immediate, everyday threats could uniquely humanize them and rebuild public trust in climate science. Even in a media landscape saturated with stories of climate impacts, highlighting scientists’ concrete and benevolent actions – “saviors of children in summer camps” – might humanize them and bridge divides in public trust.\",\"Theoretical motivation\\nMost interventions aiming to change climate beliefs, including trust in climate scientists, have failed (1,2). We believe this is because distrust in climate scientists stems from deep “attitude roots” – psychological foundations such as perceived vested interests, ideological bias, and elite manipulation (3) that shape key dimensions of trust: competence, integrity, and benevolence (4). Until now, we’ve lacked tools to identify and directly address these roots.\\n\\nIn previous work, we already showed that Generative AI can reduce misinformation about electric vehicles (5) and climate skepticism (6). However, these approaches relied on static or poorly structured prompts, limiting adaptability – especially within a 5-minute intervention.\\n\\nWe propose a novel AI-based intervention using dynamic prompting to (a) diagnose the specific attitude root underlying a participant’s distrust of climate scientists, and (b) engage them in a brief, tailored conversation aimed at challenging that root.\\n\\n\\nWhy the intervention is effective\\nParticipants interact with a chat window embedded in their Qualtrics survey. Because we neither assume distrust nor wish to steer participants toward a specific root, the AI begins with an open prompt:\\n\\n“I’d like to understand your views on climate scientists. When you hear them talk about climate change, do you doubt them? If so, why?”\\n\\nBased on the response, the AI identifies the relevant attitude root and initiates a polite but confrontational evidence-based exchange.\\n\\nWe adopt a confrontational tone rather than the empathetic style typical of science communication. Brief, assertive public health campaigns have proven highly effective with limited attention spans, creating a cognitive disruption that bypasses defensiveness and prompts reflection (7).\\n\\nWe already implemented the base paradigm for your convenience, so you can see it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTy0xGXiy8c. Technical integration is straightforward; our team can assist as needed. All LLM (API) costs will be covered by our institution, and existing ethics approval for AI conversations can serve as a precedent for your review process.\\n\\nHow it could be applied in real-world settings\\nThe intervention is deployable through digital platforms – such as public information websites, social media, or museum kiosks – engaging users in short, personalised conversations about climate science. Its scalable, automated design enables wide-reaching, cost-effective applications in public communication, education, and policy outreach.\\n\\n\\n1.\\tChan, M.-P. S. & Albarracín, D. (2023).

After 30 seconds, you can continue with the questionnaire:\\n\\nClimate scientists develop models to forecast climate-related risks, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and long-term temperature changes. These models are not only used in research. They are increasingly used by the private sector, where decisions have financial consequences.\\n\\nFor example, insurance companies rely on climate scientists’ projections when calculating premiums and assessing risks. If climate projections underestimate future risks, insurance companies lose money. Because of this, insurers carefully evaluate the data and only rely on sources they consider reliable and accurate. Companies assess climate scientists’ work with financial incentives in mind and avoid basing decisions on information they view as biased or ideological.\\n\\nLarge corporations also integrate climate projections into their long-term planning. Companies use climate data to plan supply chains, choose new locations, and identify potential risks to their business. In addition, many private-sector companies now actively recruit climate scientists to work in-house and help guide strategic and financial decisions.\\n\\nIn other words, organizations with strong financial incentives are acting based on climate science. They rely on climate scientists’ work because their models help them make informed, risk-sensitive decisions.\\n\",\"(Participants see a carbon inequality chart along with the following text)\\n\\nThe climate crisis is a fight between the richest 10%, those who cause half of all global emissions, and us, the people who bear the consequences.\\n\\nIn this fight, scientists stand with us. Climate science exposes who pollutes, who profits, and who should pay the price. It gives us the tools to demand fairness and to build solutions that hold the biggest emitters accountable. The burden cannot fall on those already struggling to make ends meet. Real change must come from those who cause the most harm and have the power to make it right.\\n\\nThe richest 10% understand this. That is why some try to cast doubt on science and turn people away from it, because acknowledging the truth would mean facing their responsibility. \\n\\nBut by staying united, we, scientists and people, can win against them for truth and justice.\",\"Participants could read a text in which a climate scientist explain the nature of work in the community of climate scientists, focusing on how they deal with lacks knowledge, being wrong and collaborating with others. The exact context and topic can depend on other interventions; here is an example:\\n\\nAs climate scientists, we spend a lot of time questioning our own ideas. It’s not that we enjoy being wrong — but we know that every mistake or unexpected result helps us understand the climate system a little better. Our goal isn’t to defend a single theory, but to keep improving our models so they reflect reality as closely as possible.\\n\\nSometimes, new data completely overturn what we thought we knew. For example, our early models underestimated the role of ocean currents in regulating temperature. When the evidence showed otherwise, we had to admit we were wrong and rebuild our assumptions from the ground up. That process was humbling, but it made our predictions far more accurate.\\n\\nNo one works in isolation. Our models only improve when we bring together expertise from many fields — from atmospheric physics to oceanography, agriculture, and even psychology. A few years ago, a behavioral scientist pointed out that our risk projections didn’t account for how communities actually respond to extreme weather. She was right, and that insight changed how we think about climate impacts.\\n\\nIn the end, climate science is a collective effort to get closer to the truth, even if that means revising our ideas again and again.\",\"We’d like to ask a few short questions about your values and beliefs. \\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\nHow much do you agree or disagree with the following statements?\\n\\nEveryone should be held to the same standards of honesty and fairness.\\nIt is important that taxpayer-funded programs show exactly how their money is spent.\\nBig money has too much influence on what gets researched. \\nSometimes people in powerful positions push certain ideas not because they’re true, but because they fit their political or financial interests. \\n\\n0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree.\\n\\n—page break—-\\nThank you for sharing your thoughts.\\nMany Americans care deeply about fairness, honesty, and transparency in public decision-making.\\n—page break—-\\nNext, you’ll answer a few questions about your beliefs and attitudes concerning climate scientists. \\n—page break—-\\n\\n“Climate scientists are paid to support certain climate policies.”\\n0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree.\\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\nCorrection: \\nThe median salary of environmental scientists is $80,060, which is comparable to other academic researchers in public universities. \\n\\nIn fact, earth and environmental science researchers working at public universities earn less on average than faculty in the economics, business and law departments. \\n\\nThis salary comes from their employers, which include universities, government agencies, and private companies. \\n\\nBut climate scientists are not paid by government agencies to propose policy solutions. \\n\\nIn fact, scientists who work on US National Climate Assessment are not paid at all for their contributions.

Only 3% of programs that received federal funding for “climate” research were primarily focused on climate change. \\n\\nSo while the government does fund climate change research, the amount that the government spends on climate change research is relatively small. \\n\\nSources: https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-223.pdf\\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\n“Climate scientists receive large amounts of funding.”\\n0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree.\\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\nCorrection: \\nWhile climate scientists salaries aren’t overwhelming on average, many scientists receive grants for research. How does that impact climate scientists' work and pay? \\n\\nMost grant dollars go towards paying for the research itself, not the scientists.\\n\\nEquipment and data collection for research takes up a significant portion of grant money. A $400,000 grant might pay a scientist less than $17,000 annually over three years.\\n\\nHow can we know that’s true? Federal and university grant systems are highly transparent. Every research award, including those for climate science, must disclose spending details. This information is publicly accessible through platforms like USAspending.gov and university reporting systems.\\n\\nLike government spending on climate research, grants for climate research are also harder to come by than compared to other fields. In fact, climate science receives a lot less funding than most other sciences. Only 0.26% of funding from the National Institute of Health goes towards climate science. \\n\\nSo not only do most grants go towards other fields, but even when climate scientists receive grants, the money pays for equipment and data collection. Climate scientists do not make a lot of money from grants. \\n\\nSources: ASA Research analysis of U.S. Department of Education, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, Faculty Salary data, 2022-23 and 2023-24\\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\n“Climate research takes up a lot of taxpayer money.”\\n0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree.\\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\nCorrection: \\nLarge dollar figures often associated with “climate spending” — such as funding in the Inflation Reduction Act — do not reflect spending on climate research.

The post looks like something you might genuinely see online: a short statement and a few hashtags. Read the message:\\n“We’re climate scientists and we believe in questions.\\nWhen people question climate research, it’s not a threat. It’s an invitation to look closer, test harder, and keep learning together.\\n\\nScience works because it stays open to learning. We don’t get everything right the first time, and that’s part of the process. When new evidence emerges, we revise our understanding, share our data, and invite others to test our ideas – because accuracy matters, especially when people’s lives and livelihoods are at stake.\\n\\nEvery insight builds on the work of countless others: researchers, field experts, communities, and generations before us who asked hard questions of their own.\\n\\nThat openness to being corrected isn’t a weakness – it’s how scientists build trust in their findings.\\n\\nSo, bring your questions. Bring your doubts. They help us refine our work, uncover better evidence, and see what we might have missed. \\n\\nThat’s how progress happens – through curiosity, correction, and collaboration – it’s why you can trust the climate science community to keep learning, improving, and protecting our planet together.\\n\\n#ScienceIsListening #AskMoreQuestions”\\n\\nStep 2: Example\\n“Title: Science progresses because it stays open to learning\\nHere’s one example of how that openness led to better science and stronger protection for communities.\\nFor many years, climate scientists and land managers believed that the safest approach to wildfires was to suppress every fire as quickly as possible. Over time, evidence showed that this strategy caused forests to become overcrowded and dry—making wildfires more severe, not less.\\nInstead of defending the old approach, climate scientists recognized they had more to learn. They listened to firefighters, tribal fire experts, and local communities, understanding that others held deep, place-based knowledge. Together, they developed controlled burn practices that reduce fuel build-up and protect homes, wildlife, and forests.\\nThis example shows that climate science isn’t a fixed story or a belief system—it’s a community of people continually learning, revising, and improving so communities can make better decisions, together\\nThis is what climate science looks like:\\n- Listen to the evidence\\n- Learn from others\\n- Acknowledge uncertainty\\n- Adapt to protect communities\\nWhat matters is that the scientists are willing to learn, adjust, and do better for the people who depend on them.“\",\"Step 1: Main text\\nIt’s easy to say you trust climate scientists; it’s harder to stake real money on it.\\nLarge insurance companies make billion-dollar decisions about which areas to insure and at what price. If their forecasts are wrong, they pay for it – literally. That’s why many now rely on climate scientists’ projections to calculate risk and plan for future losses.\\nThese firms aren’t environmental groups; they exist to protect profit and reduce risk. When they build scientific climate data into their models, they’re sending a clear signal: climate scientists’ work is rigorous, reliable, and worth trusting.\\n\\nStep 2: Examples\\nInsurers aren’t the only ones listening to climate scientists.\\nMajor banks, energy companies, and manufacturers now use scientific climate projections in their long-term planning — stress-testing their portfolios against future scenarios, from higher sea levels to shifts in global energy markets.\\nAcross industries, businesses are partnering with scientists not to make politics, but to make better decisions. They apply the findings and adapt their operations based on the best available evidence about extreme weather, resource scarcity, and global change.\\nThis collaboration highlights something important: climate scientists aren’t in it for profit — they share their methods and findings openly to help protect people and communities — but their work is so dependable that even the most profit-focused organizations trust it.\\n\\nStep 3: Reflection\\nTake a moment to think about what you’ve just read.\\n\\nMany companies that depend on accuracy and profit - from insurers to global manufacturers - trust climate scientists to guide their decisions.\\nWhy might so many profit-driven companies stake their livelihoods on climate scientists when planning for the future?\",\"Some people think that climate scientists cannot be trusted. You’d be forgiven for feeling that way, because the fossil fuel industry has bankrolled a multi-decade propaganda campaign specifically designed to undermine the public’s trust in climate science and scientists. Don’t let oil companies mislead you: trust the climate scientists, not the vested interests that have tried to discredit them. \\n\\nIn reality, oil companies have known for over 60 years that their products can cause global warming. In the 1970s and 80s, oil companies employed climate scientists, conducted climate science research, and agreed with academic and federal scientists that burning fossil fuels would lead to climate change. But instead of alerting the public or taking action, the fossil fuel industry did the opposite: they (1) attacked climate science and scientists, (2) lobbied politicians against climate and clean energy policies, and (3) spent billions of dollars on advertising propaganda while raking in record profits. Their goal was to stop action on climate change by undermining the public’s trust in climate science and scientists.\\n\\nOil companies knew.\\nOver the past decade, historians and journalists have discovered internal memos from oil companies showing that the oil industry has known since the 1950s that their products could cause dangerous climate change. By 1959–more than 60 years ago–they knew that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming “sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York.” During the 1970s and 80s, scientists at one oil giant predicted global warming with breathtaking accuracy and warned executives of “potentially catastrophic” climate effects. Oil companies employed and worked with many of the world’s top climate scientists. \\n\\nOil companies lied.\\nDespite the fossil fuel industry’s early knowledge of climate science and early work with climate scientists, oil companies spent the next two decades misleading the American public with a well-funded disinformation campaign that denied the reality and severity of human-caused climate change. Their goal was to confuse the public and policymakers in order to delay action and protect profits. To do so, the oil industry and its allies manufactured a false debate about climate change in order to undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and human-caused. The fossil fuel industry’s internal memos made this propaganda strategy explicit: “Emphasize the uncertainty” in climate science and “Reposition global warming as theory (not fact).” \\n\\nAttacking climate science.\\nAs part of this attack on the scientific consensus, oil companies issued statements and advertisements claiming that climate science was “unsettled”, which was incorrect. They also funded a small but vocal group of contrarian scientists and fake experts to create the false illusion that “independent experts” disagreed with mainstream scientists. \\n\\nAttacking climate scientists.\\nClimate scientists themselves also became the victims of an orchestrated smear campaign. For example, when one world-renowned climate scientist coauthored a major report concluding that human-caused global warming was underway, he was publicly accused of fraud and corruption by an oil-industry front group. When another prominent climate scientist coauthored research confirming rapid global warming over the past century, he was harassed for years by bogus legal complaints filed by organizations funded by fossil fuel interests. \\n\\nLobbying politicians against climate and clean energy policies.\\nBetween 2000 and 2016, oil interests spent $2 billion lobbying Congress against climate change legislation. They outspent environmental groups by 10-to-1.\\n\\nSpending billions of dollars on advertising propaganda.\\nFrom 1986 to 2015, five oil companies alone spent $3.6 billion on advertising.\\n\\nBig Oil is the new Big Tobacco. It can’t be trusted.\\nThe oil industry’s tactics came straight out of the playbook used by tobacco companies: sabotage the science and slander the scientists. In the process, the American public has been denied the right to be accurately informed about and protected against climate change, just as they were denied the right to be informed about the dangers of smoking by the tobacco industry. When it comes to climate change, don’t trust the oil companies, trust the climate scientists. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBrulle, R.

How the fossil fuel industry harassed climate scientist Michael Mann. https://www.ucs.org/resources/how-fossil-fuel-industry-harassed-climate-scientist-michael-mann\",\"Climate scientists are researchers who study the Earth’s climate system — the intricate web of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surfaces, and living organisms that together regulate the planet’s temperature and weather patterns over time.\\n\\nTheir main goal is to understand how these components influence one another and how they have changed throughout Earth’s history. To achieve this, climate scientists rely on a wide range of evidence. They analyze long-term temperature and precipitation records collected from weather stations around the globe, satellite data that monitor variations in sea surface temperatures and polar ice cover, and natural archives that preserve traces of past climates.\\n\\nTo understand the climate of the distant past, scientists drill deep into the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to extract ice cores — cylinders of compacted snow and ice that can record hundreds of thousands of years of environmental history. Each layer of ice corresponds to a specific year of snowfall, and these layers can be dated using several techniques, such as identifying volcanic ash deposits. Each eruption leaves a distinct chemical fingerprint that allows researchers to assign precise ages to different layers. Once dated, the ice cores are analyzed for the tiny air bubbles they contain, which hold ancient greenhouse gases like CO₂ and CH₄, while the isotopic composition of the surrounding ice reveals past temperatures.\\n\\nClimate scientists work in a variety of environments — from remote polar research stations and deep-sea expeditions to data laboratories and climate modeling centers. Their studies often focus on large-scale phenomena such as glaciations, droughts, monsoon cycles, or ocean-atmosphere interactions like El Niño and La Niña, which strongly affect weather patterns around the globe.\\n\\nIn parallel with reconstructions of past climates, climatologists continuously monitor the modern atmosphere through a global network of CO₂ observatories and satellites like NASA’s OCO-2. By analyzing how carbon dioxide absorbs sunlight at specific wavelengths, they can precisely measure its concentration in the air — a level of sensitivity comparable to detecting a single drop of ink in an Olympic-size swimming pool.\\n\\nBy studying these processes, climate scientists are able to identify the mechanisms driving changes in the climate and predict their impact on ecosystems, sea levels, and human societies. Their findings inform international assessments, such as those conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and guide global efforts to mitigate climatic threats, such as heatwaves, droughts, or flooding, and promote sustainable solutions.\",\"Manipulation materials\\n\\nKindly note that participants in this intervention condition will be randomly presented with information featuring either a military, farmer, or religious cue.

In my view, it’s time to recognize the role that human activities play in heating our planet—and to act—before the stability of our food system and the security of our dinner tables are compromised beyond repair.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\tUnconventional advocates: religious cue + moral stewardship\\nPlease read the following op-ed from U.S. Reverend Alex Brady, published in Faith & Public Life in November 2024.\\nBrady is a lifelong Christian pastor and a member of the Catholic Climate Covenant.\\nTrust Our Faith Leaders: Climate Change is Threatening God’s Creation and We Are to Blame\\n\\nAs a pastor, I believe that humans are responsible for climate change and that it poses a serious threat to the wellbeing of God’s creation. Here’s what Scripture and the best available scientific research tell us about how our actions are affecting the planet entrusted to our care.\\n\\nUp until about 150 years ago, human activity did not produce many greenhouse gases. That changed as important inventions and industrial innovations, like the widespread use of electricity and cars, transformed the way we live. These advances demand energy. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas has become an important source of that energy.\\n\\nBurning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth’s surface and raising global temperatures. It’s a natural process, but human activities have intensified it—trapping more heat than ever before. Scientists tell us that these changes are driven by human behavior and are already harming communities, wildlife, and the most vulnerable among us. Droughts, floods, and fires are displacing families and damaging the lands that sustain us—all of which violates our moral duty of stewardship.\\n\\nPeople of faith, regardless of denomination or politics, should listen to religious leaders and scientists who share a common concern for creation. In my view, it’s time for us to acknowledge our role in warming the planet and to take responsibility—before we betray both our faith and the future generations who depend on us.\",\"“Trust in climate scientists is growing. In 2016, only 39% of Americans said they trusted climate scientists a lot to give accurate information about climate change. Recent research has shown that this number increased to 54% in 2022; a growth of 15%. This trend suggests a growing part of Americans have confidence in climate scientists’ integrity and competence.”\",\"Climate science follows a standardized set of rules and procedures that all scientists defer to when producing scientific knowledge. Naturally, most people who are not experts in climate science may not be aware of this rigorous scientific method that is used by climate scientists. Next, we will briefly describe this method:\\n\\n“Though people might not think of climate science as a science like other sciences, it relies on the same quantitative methods, using mathematical data. Climate science translates natural phenomena into numerical information and analyzes observable patterns in order to estimate probabilities and make forecasts about these natural phenomena.\\nWhen conducting their research, climate scientists first collect vast amounts of data using meticulous instruments, such as satellites or ocean buoys. All of this numeric data is quite precise in the way it captures the properties or elements of natural phenomena under study. For example, ocean buoys can measure sub-surface temperature, water chemical composition, or barometric pressure.\\nAfter collecting these raw data, climate scientists analyze them using sophisticated algebraic operations. They develop statistical models and computational simulations based on mathematical equations with multiple parameters. Among many other techniques, climate scientists may analyze their data with spatial interpolation, support vector machines, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, or spectral and wavelet analysis. These statistical analyses are quite complex, and therefore climate scientists rely on high-performance computing systems to estimate parameters that could not be calculated manually. \\nSo, for example, if climate science research finds that \\\"urban areas face heightened vulnerability to heatwaves and flooding\\\", this conclusion is merely the description of the information embedded in the data collected and subsequent analyses. To arrive at this conclusion, climate scientists would collect data in urban and non-urban areas and then compare them. They could, for example, track temperature exceedance thresholds and quantify rainfall anomaly indices or atmospheric moisture content, as well as register the characteristics of the areas themselves, such as the soil's evapotranspiration or hydraulic conductivity. They would then incorporate all this information into the models and analysis strategies described in the previous paragraph to arrive at a numeric quantification of the extent to which urban and non-urban areas are at risk for heatwaves and flooding, before statistically comparing the magnitude of these values.\\nThe quantitative focus of climate science ensures that it produces rigorous and reliable knowledge that is reproducible by other scientists. Ideally, this helps policymakers inform their decisions on empirical evidence - that is, on quantifiable measured patterns -, rather than on their subjective discernment.”\\n\",\"Temporary Questions/Scenarios \\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: Handling Uncertainty (Competence)\\n\\\"Your data shows a trend but isn't 100% certain.

You're convinced people make good decisions when given proper information.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists work hard to make findings understandable without oversimplifying. They share uncertainties openly because they respect that people deserve the whole truth. Just like climate scientists, you also don't hide the uncertainties - you explain. Climate scientists publish data, methods, and doubts transparently because trust is built through openness, not perfect answers.\\n\\nProfile 2: \\\"The Rigorous Sceptic\\\"\\nHighest scores: Competence + Integrity + Openness\\nYour values: You take accuracy seriously and only trust well-evidenced information. You ask critical questions to ensure conclusions are truly sound. Acknowledging mistakes is strength, not a weakness.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists are professional sceptics. Their job is questioning theories, searching for errors, and only claiming what they can demonstrate. They undergo intensive peer review where experts try to find weaknesses - because thorough criticism leads to better results. When they discover errors, they publish corrections because scientific integrity comes first. That's your standard too.\\n\\nProfile 3: \\\"The Principled Guardian\\\"\\nHighest scores: Integrity + Competence + Benevolence (balanced)\\nYour values: You aren't swayed by external pressure and stand by what's right - even when uncomfortable. You believe truth and integrity matter more long-term than short-term advantages, whilst still wanting to help.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists face enormous pressure from political camps, interest groups, and funders. Yet they report results as data show them, not as others wish. They develop strict ethical standards to protect independence because trust is based on principles. Integrity is non-negotiable.\\n\\nProfile 4: \\\"The Collaborative Realist\\\"\\nHighest scores: Benevolence + Openness + Competence\\nYour values: You believe in collaboration's power and that best solutions emerge when perspectives unite. You share generously, listen carefully, and want your work to help others make informed decisions.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate research is an enormous collaborative project. Thousands of scientists share data, check each other's work, and build upon one another because complex problems require joint efforts. They work with economists, sociologists, engineers, and policy experts because findings are only valuable if they help others decide better. Their research serves the common good - like your values.\\n\\nProfile 5: \\\"The Balanced Professional\\\"\\nHighest scores: All dimensions relatively equal (within 20%)\\nYour values: You find balance between requirements. You're thorough but pragmatic, open but protective of quality, clear but responsible in communication.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists constantly navigate complex trade-offs: How to communicate uncertainty without being misunderstood? How to remain independent whilst funding research? How to share worrying findings without exaggerating or downplaying? Like you, they make daily decisions balancing different values. They're neither naive idealists nor cynical opportunists - they're realists doing work with integrity whilst operating in a complex world. That's your balanced approach too.\\n\\nProfile 6: \\\"The Methodical Scientist\\\"\\nHighest scores: Competence + Integrity (Openness/Benevolence lower)\\nYour values: You take responsibility seriously and want to ensure you never cause harm. You prefer caution, thorough checking, and clear boundaries. Care matters more than speed.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists carry enormous responsibility - findings influence policies affecting millions. That's why they take accuracy seriously. They've developed strict protocols, multiple checks, and conservative estimates because they understand their work's consequences. They recognise limits, saying \\\"This is my expertise\\\" and \\\"This is outside my field\\\" because responsible action means knowing where competencies end. Their caution isn't weakness - it's strength based on responsibility.\\n\\nProfile 7: \\\"The Isolated Sceptic\\\"\\nHighest scores: All dimensions predominantly negative\\nYour values: You tend to prioritise self-protection and caution above collaboration and transparency. You may feel that sharing information or admitting uncertainty makes you vulnerable, so you prefer to keep things close to your chest.\\nWhat separates you from climate scientists: Climate science thrives on openness, collaboration, and intellectual honesty - values that might feel risky to you right now. But climate scientists weren't born with these values; they learned them through practice. These are learnable skills. Every scientist has faced moments of wanting to hide errors or ignore criticism. The difference is they've built practices that support doing the harder, more honest thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScoring\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate dimension totals\\nIntegrity: Sum all Integrity scores from Q1-Q6\\nCompetence: Sum all Competence scores from Q1-Q6\\nOpenness: Sum all Openness scores from Q1-Q6\\nBenevolence: Sum all Benevolence scores from Q1-Q6\\n\\nStep 2: Identify top 2-3 dimensions (highest scores)\\n\\nStep 3: Assign Profile According to Top Dimensions\\n\\nOpen + Ben + Int (all high) = Transparent Communicator\\nComp + Int + Open (all high) = Rigorous Sceptic\\nInt + Comp + Ben (balanced, Int highest) = Principled Guardian\\nBen + Open + Comp (Ben/Open highest) = Collaborative Realist\\nAll within 20% of each other = Balanced Professional\\nComp + Int high, Open/Ben lower = Methodical Scientist\\nMostly negative; all dimensions low = Isolated Sceptic\",\"Every day, scientists around the world make discoveries. But before those discoveries are shared, they face one of the toughest tests in any profession: peer review. This means that highly proficient experts, often even direct competitors, carefully examine the research to see if it holds up. They check whether the evidence is solid, whether the reasoning makes sense, and whether the results truly support the conclusions. If they find any problems, the study must be revised or rejected. Only after passing this tough test, the work is accepted as part of the scientific record. It’s a process designed to catch errors, make sure the science is solid, and move knowledge forward\\nPeer review is the foundation of scientific trust. It shows that science is not based on individual opinion, but on collective expert judgment. In effect, it is scientists holding each other accountable to the highest standards of accuracy and honesty.\\nClimate science works exactly this way. Every credible study on climate change has been reviewed and approved by multiple independent experts. This means the findings you hear about—rising global temperatures, shifting weather patterns, melting glaciers—are not just one researcher’s claim. They represent the shared evaluation of specialists who have been trained to become experts in understanding the planet.\\nWhen experts across the world examine the same evidence and consistently reach the same conclusions, that agreement is powerful proof. It tells us the science is solid and that trust in climate scientists is justified.\\nPeer review is what turns individual research into collective understanding. It is the reason scientific progress is reliable. Peer review is why climate science deserves your confidence.\\nFor most studies in climate research: \\n✅ The science was double-checked. Reliable climate studies are reviewed by independent experts. \\n🤝 Experts agree. When multiple experts examine the evidence and agree, this means the findings are reliable. \\n🌟Scientists trust the process. Rigorous peer review is the system that keeps all science credible. That’s why climate science deserves your trust.\",\"Step 1 - Shared-Values Framing and Humanization\\nParticipants first see a positive, community-oriented image and headline linking climate science to everyday American values.\\nText above: “Working together for safer, stronger communities.” \\nImage: a farmer using soil-moisture sensors with a local researcher and/or a firefighter with a scientist reviewing wildfire maps and/or scientists looking at weather/storm forecast maps.\\n“Title: Climate science is about helping people protect what matters most  — our families, our homes, and the places we all call home.\\n\\nClimate scientists are neighbors, parents, and community members too. They use tools like weather sensors, soil data, and fire-mapping technology to help our communities prepare and recover. \\nFrom local farms to coastal towns, scientists and residents work side by side—often as one and the same—to keep families safe and livelihoods secure. Their work supports the same goals shared by everyone: keeping homes safe, land healthy, and future generations protected.”\\n\\nStep 2 - Example 1\\n“Title: Neighbours helping neighbours\\nAlong the Gulf Coast, many climate scientists live in the same towns they study. They volunteer in local shelters, send their kids to the same schools, and worry about the same storms.\\nDuring Hurricane Harvey (2017), local scientists worked side-by-side with emergency managers, meteorologists, and neighborhood volunteers to track rainfall and rising floodwaters.\\n{image of evacuations} \\nTheir real-time flood-risk maps helped firefighters and community groups identify which neighborhoods to evacuate first – especially where children, seniors, and hospitals were located.\\nClimate scientists aren’t outsiders looking in – they are community members using their skills to help keep families safe.”\\n\\nStep 3 - Example 2\\n“Title: Scientists and local fire crews work together to keep communities safe\\nIn Western states, climate scientists work closely with firefighters and local emergency teams by providing real-time wildfire spread models – on the ground, season after season. These models predict how fast a fire may move and which communities are most at risk.\\nDuring the 2020 wildfire season in California and Oregon, scientists used fire spread forecasts to help local responders decide where to strengthen fire lines and when to call for early evacuations.\\n\\nThese decisions helped protect schools, retirement homes, and small neighborhoods tucked near forests.\\n{Image of family being safe, hugging each other after a fire} \\nMost of the scientists involved weren’t outsiders — they live in these communities, raise families there, and care deeply about the places at risk.\\nThis helped save numerous lives.”\\n\\nStep 4 - Example 3\\n“Title: But climate science isn’t only used during emergencies.\\nMuch of the work happens quietly, every day, to support healthy land, stable food supplies, and reliable weather planning — things every community depends on.\\nScientists work with farmers to track soil moisture and crop conditions, helping protect harvests during dry seasons.\\nThey provide weather and heat forecasts that help families plan daily routines and keep children and older adults safe on hot days.\\nThey study coastal erosion, river levels, and seasonal storms so towns can maintain roads, schools, and homes.\\nThis work is rarely on the news — but it helps communities stay steady, healthy, and prepared.\\n{images of healthy crops and healthy environments (e.g., a clean river)}\\nClimate scientists aren’t just studying the environment — they’re taking care of home.”\\n\\nStep 5 - Reflection \\n“Climate scientists work behind the scenes to make life safer and help us plan better. Can you think of an example of how climate science has benefitted your community or people you care about?” (open text)\\nProviding concrete, relatable examples in Steps 2, 3, and 4 before asking participants to reflect reduces the risk that they ‘draw a blank’ or feel put on the spot.

We invite readers, researchers, and members of the public to share their thoughts on these new measures.\\nOur goal is to make every stage of the review process clear and accessible to anyone interested in how scientific results are evaluated. The following features are part of the proposed system:\\n•\\tPublic reviewer registry: All reviewers invited by the journal are listed in a continuously updated database. Each name links to independently verified professional profiles, where you can view their areas of expertise and publication records.\\n•\\tOpen evaluation criteria: The exact criteria used to assess submissions - such as data transparency, methodological rigor, and disclosure of potential conflicts of interest - are published on our website and remain available for public consultation.\\n•\\tDocumented review timelines: For each published article, a summary of key review dates shows when the paper was received, reviewed, and revised, ensuring consistency across submissions.\\n•\\tEditorial decision summaries: Each accepted paper includes a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the final decision, describing how authors responded to reviewers’ comments.\\nThese steps are designed to make the peer-review process easier to follow and to allow anyone to confirm that research is evaluated by qualified experts under consistent, clearly stated standards.\\nBefore finalizing this new system, we would value your perspective.\\nWhat additional information or documentation would you like journals to provide about how articles are reviewed?\\nPlease share your feedback using the short text box below. Your input will help us refine a process that keeps climate research open, traceable, and accountable to the scientific community and the public alike.\\n\",\"You are a polite AI assistant who is mildly skeptical about trusting climate scientists. Begin by asking the participant why you should trust them. In 2–3 short exchanges, challenge their points with common concerns (e.g., bias, errors, funding motives) while remaining open to persuasion. Conclude by acknowledging that they have made good points and that you now believe climate scientists deserve trust. Avoid political insults, offensive content, or false factual claims. Keep each reply under 60 words.\",\"How do you communicate successfully in different discussions?\\n\\nRecent social-psychological research shows that recognizing the limits of one’s own knowledge is crucial for constructive dialogue. In controversial discussions, reflecting on one’s intellectual limitations fosters respect for differing viewpoints and openness toward others. Awareness of what one does not know encourages genuine engagement and reduces defensiveness, allowing conversations to focus less on who is right and more on shared understanding. Recognizing that our knowledge is incomplete encourages more respectful dialogue, lowers tension between opposing sides, and makes finding common ground easier.\\n\\nAdapted and made more concise from: Knöchelmann et al., 2025, which was adapted from Porter et al., 2020.\",\"TITLE: \\\"Science Above Politics: A Former Skeptic's Defense of Climate Science\\\"\\n\\nBODY: When Jennifer Rukavina became a television meteorologist, she noticed her colleagues were divided into two camps: believers and nonbelievers. Ms. Rukavina didn’t know at first which camp she fell into, but she certainly wasn’t “convinced” about climate change.\\n\\nAs a group, meteorologists are no more or less likely than the general public to say that humans are the primary cause of climate change. In the early 2000s, when Ms. Rukavina began her career, Al Gore, the former vice president and climate change activist, had just released his film “An Inconvenient Truth.” The split among her colleagues, Ms. Rukavina said, was largely focused around the political “theater” surrounding the film, which experts often describe as a flash point in the deepening partisan divide on climate change.\\n\\n“I decided that I needed to educate myself, because the meteorologist is often viewed as the station scientist,” Ms. Rukavina said. In 2008, she attended her first Glen Gerberg Weather and Climate Summit — a meeting of weathercasters and climate scientists — in Colorado. After hearing from the scientists themselves, Ms. Rukavina said, she changed her mind.\\n\\n“I am a registered Republican, but I don’t let politics dictate what good science is to me,” she said. Every year since, Ms. Rukavina has briefed her WPSD viewers live from the conference. “It really doesn’t matter to me what my viewers think of climate change,” she said. “What matters to me most is being able to prepare them for the changes that lie ahead.”\\n\",\"Climate science not a matter of political views: Scientists are doing their job well, leading Democrats and Republicans say unanimously\\n\\nAt last night’s National Symposium of Environmental Policymakers, leading Democrats and Republicans stated that climate scientists have provided highly reliable evidence on human-made climate change—regardless of whether those scientists affiliate with liberal or conservative political positions. Congressman Peter Franklin said: “Think about scientists like John Downey and Sarah Rickenbacker: While Downey supports conservative think tanks, Rickenbacker is well-known for her liberal agenda—but both won the Baker Prize for rigorous, excellent climate research”. After all, party leaders emphasized in a joint statement: “Most climate scientists do not seek to promote any political agenda. They follow the norms of science, which rest on non-partisan principles. These principles make them conduct high-quality research that adheres to ethical standards, is in the best interest of the American people, and makes scientists listen to people’s needs.”\",\"Climate forecasting involves uncertainty. Not because it’s flawed, but because that’s how good science works. Expert researchers measure this uncertainty, share their methods publicly, invite peer review, and update their forecasts as new data emerges. This openness and willingness to refine their work helps reduce uncertainty and gets us closer to the reality.\",\"Science advances through an ongoing process of testing, refinement, and discovery. In some areas, evidence is so strong that scientists reach near-universal agreement. In others, uncertainty remains as researchers continue to collect data and improve models. This uncertainty is not a weakness but a fundamental part of how science progresses. Through careful methodology, replication, and continual evaluation, scientists build confidence in their conclusions. \\n\\nNow we would like you to make estimations about scientific certainty.  Please indicate the percentage of scientists you think agree with each of the below statements.\\n\\n[Randomize with #3 always in the middle]\\n1)“Human activities are the primary cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.” [0-100 slider]\\n2)“Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet.” [0-100 slider]\\n3)“Doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lead to the earth warming 3°C.” [0-100 slider]\\n4)“Smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer.”  [0-100 slider]\\n\\nCorrect answers: \\n99%\\n100%\\n75%\\n100%\\n\\n\\nFeedback: Given directly after each item\\n\\n1)Surveys and reviews show that about 99 % of climate scientists agree that human activities—especially burning coal, oil, and gas—are the main cause of recent global warming. This conclusion comes from many independent lines of evidence: satellite temperature records, ocean-heat measurements, retreating glaciers, and physical models of the atmosphere. The agreement exists because multiple methods point to the same result, not because of any single study.\\n\\n2)Nearly all climate scientists — over 99.99 % — agree that rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the planet to warm. This rests on well-tested physics: CO₂ traps heat that would otherwise escape to space. The effect has been confirmed in laboratory experiments, atmospheric observations, and computer simulations that reproduce past climate changes. The consistency of results across so many approaches shows how robust this finding is.\\n\\n3)Climate scientists agree that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will warm Earth, but they don’t all give the same exact number for how much. Most studies place the likely range between 2.5 °C and 4 °C, with about 75 % of experts identifying around 3 °C as the central estimate. These estimates come from an iterative process: scientists build models based on physics, test them against real-world data, publish results, and invite others to re-analyze or challenge them. When new evidence appears—like better satellite readings or improved cloud modeling—forecasts are updated. That cycle of testing, questioning, and self-correction is what makes scientific understanding more reliable over time.\\n\\n4)Virtually all medical and public-health scientists agree that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer. This conclusion comes from decades of independent studies showing that smokers are many times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers. Evidence from epidemiology, laboratory research, and clinical trials all point to the same cause–effect relationship.\\n\\nAttention check: Which statement had the least scientific consensus?

How would you explain what you do?\\n \\nAlex: I study extreme weather, so things like heat waves, heavy rainfall, storms, and I work with local officials, schools, and emergency teams so people have clear information to plan and stay safe. A lot of the job is translating forecasts into something useful for everyday decisions.\\n \\nHost: What put you on this path?\\n \\nAlex: I {{EDUCATION_PHRASE}}. Over time, I realized how much weather shapes daily life, from power bills and farming to school schedules and outdoor work. {{POL_PHRASE}}. Climate work let me apply that in a practical way, where better information helps a community prepare and avoid harm. \\n \\nHost: Did where you grew up influence your interests?\\n \\nAlex: Definitely. I {{REGION_PHRASE}}. You pay attention when storms roll in or there’s a long dry stretch; and you see how neighbors depend on each other. Those experiences made me appreciate how closely weather and community life are connected.\\n \\nHost: What’s a typical week like for you?\\n \\nAlex: It varies. Some days I’m analyzing weather patterns; others I’m on calls with local planners or emergency managers. Outside the job, I {{AGE_PHRASE}} — I cook, spend time with friends, follow local sports, and get outside when I can. Pretty normal stuff. \\n \\nHost: What keeps you motivated?\\n \\nAlex: When someone says a warning helped them prepare, or kept older relatives safe during a heat wave, that really matters. Science can be quiet work, but if it helped protect a family or kept a community running, that’s enough for me.\\n\\nIntervention page 3\\nThanks for reading the interview transcript.

She works with farmers and forest managers who want to keep their land healthy and productive. Together, they decide which trees to plant, when to thin, and how to reduce wildfire risk.\\n\\nHer work supports local economies and protects the natural resources families rely on — from timber and crops to clean water. The data she collects helps towns handle heavier rains and helps foresters manage pests that spread during hotter summers. Her work informs federal, state, and local governments to reduce fire hazards and help communities prepare for severe weather. \\n\\nIt’s a job that blends practical experience, fieldwork, and collaborating with local residents.\\n\\nWhat many don’t realize is that Adrienne is a climate scientist. Like engineers, doctors, and mechanics, climate scientists rely on careful measurement and teamwork to protect the places people call home.\\n\\nAnd while her story is one example, there are many others like her – climate scientists quietly doing practical, community-focused work every day.\\n\\nLearn more about Adrienne Keller: https://forestadaptation.org/team/adrienne-keller\\n\\nComprehension Questions \\n\\n1.

The first temperature records began in England in the 1640s. Around the same time, scholars started to examine trade winds and monsoon systems. \\n\\nThroughout the 19th century, our understanding of the Earth’s climate system improved significantly. In the 1850s, physicists Eunice Foote and John Tyndall discovered the natural greenhouse effect. They found that certain gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. This finding stimulated further research on how the composition of the atmosphere affects Earth’s climate. By the end of the 19th century, researchers began to consider the possibility that human emissions of greenhouse gases could cause global temperatures to rise.\\n\\nIn the 20th century, advancements in technology and systematic measurements led to new discoveries. In 1938, physicist and engineer Guy Callendar found that increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were associated with rising global temperatures. This finding was later supported by geochemist Charles Keeling’s precise measurements of atmospheric CO2 starting in 1958. The Keeling Curve, as it is known, illustrates the steady rise of CO2 levels and remains a cornerstone of climate science. \\n\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the emergence of high-performance computers allowed scientists to develop dynamic models of the Earth’s climate system. The results from these models aligned with previous findings: our climate is warming because of human greenhouse gas emissions, which have changed the composition of the atmosphere considerably. \\n\\nThe climatological knowledge we rely on today is far from new—it builds on hundreds of years of meticulous observation, experimentation, and analysis. From fundamental discoveries like the greenhouse effect to long-term carbon monitoring and paleoclimatic reconstructions, climate science stands on a robust and extensive base of evidence.\",\"Title: The Climate Scientists’ Accuracy Check\\n\\nYou may have heard the following criticism of climate scientists: they use poor computer models that are not good at predicting what will happen with the climate in the future.\\n\\nWell, it turns out that we do not have to wait many years to check if this is true. Because climate science has existed for many decades by now, we set out to see how well past models predicted what is happening right now.\\n\\nClimate scientists first began using computers to predict global temperatures in the 1970s. These early models were simple compared to today's supercomputers, but a recent extensive review of 17 different forecasts made between 1970 and 2001 found a surprising result: most of them were remarkably accurate.\\n\\nSince 1970, global average surface temperatures have risen by approximately 0.9 degrees Celsius until 2019. This study found that for many of the older models, their predicted warming was not statistically different from what actually happened. They correctly predicted the direction and, for the most part, the quantity of the temperature increase.\\n\\nWhere Were the Models Off? \\n\\nA few models did predict warming that was slightly too high or too low—by up to 0.1 degrees per decade. This is where the crucial nuance comes in: The small errors were mostly due to incorrect predictions about human behavior, not a flaw in the fundamental physics of the models.\\n\\nClimate models require two main inputs:\\n1.\\tThe Physics: How the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land behave.\\n2.\\tThe human actions: How much pollution (greenhouse gases like CO2 but also cooling aerosols) humans will emit into the atmosphere over the decades.\\nIt turns out it’s incredibly difficult to predict our future pollution. For example, some models from the 1980s that initially looked \\\"too warm\\\" didn't factor in a steep, unexpected drop in planet-warming refrigerants, resulting from the success of the 1989 Montreal Protocol to repair the ozone layer. They also sometimes overestimated the release of other gases like methane.\\n\\nWhen researchers adjusted these older models to use the actual historical pollution levels (instead of the levels they originally guessed), the predictions from those models lined up almost perfectly with the temperatures we observe today.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThis doesn't mean climate models are perfect, nor that they can predict everything – for example, it is still very difficult to predict the exact location or intensity of extreme weather events. These topics are subjects of ongoing work with increasingly sophisticated methods. But this half-century of modelling history provides strong evidence that the fundamental science used by climate scientists to project future warming has been sound for decades. \\n\\nIt confirms that we have enough information to trust the core messages of climate models – which some of the brightest minds of our time are working on.\\n\",\"Why Good Scientists Never Claim to Have the Final Word\\n\\nScience moves forward by testing, refining, and sometimes revising what we know. It’s not a sign of weakness when scientists update their conclusions—it’s a sign that the process is working. When climate scientists say that their understanding has changed—perhaps updating how fast the ice will melt or how much temperatures might rise—that’s not a failure. It’s how reliable knowledge grows.\\n\\nYou’ve probably seen the pattern before: a bold headline claims “scientists predict dramatic sea-level rise by 2050,” followed months later by a quieter update that the timeline has shifted. For some, these changes sound like “backtracking.” But in reality, they show the difference between speculation and self-correction. Science is built to evolve as new data sharpen the picture. When the underlying evidence improves, so should the conclusions.\\n\\nGood science says: here’s what we do know (for instance, humans are warming the planet), and here’s what we are still exploring (such as exactly how fast or where the effects will appear). A trustworthy scientist doesn’t pretend to know it all. Instead, they make judgments based on the best available evidence—and they make clear what remains uncertain. That openness isn’t hesitation; it’s intellectual honesty. It tells us the scientist is aware of limits and willing to update their thinking if the data demand it.\\n\\nSo next time you hear or read about changing predictions, remember: it doesn’t mean scientists were wrong to begin with. It means they were honest enough to revise their views when better information arrived. The willingness to say “we don’t fully know yet” is not the opposite of expertise—it’s proof of it. Science earns trust not by having the last word, but by never claiming to.\",\"The following is an excerpt from an interview with Dr Alex Miller, a climate scientist at a public research institute, speaking about their work and the values shared by many in the climate science community.\\n\\n\\\"Our most recent research shows that the impacts of climate change are becoming more severe than previously estimated, including increased risks to communities from heat waves, flooding, and health-related stresses. Our study analyzed temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events over the past decade, and we found that these risks are accelerating faster than models had predicted. We also observed that vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected, highlighting the urgent need for adaptation and mitigation strategies. \\n\\nI find these results deeply concerning because I care about the wellbeing of people and the places we all share. I became a climate scientist to help protect what matters most: our families, our health, our homes, and our future. My goal in sharing this research is to provide clear, honest evidence that helps everyone, regardless of background or belief, take part in shaping a safer and healthier world.\\\"\\n\",\"“An increasing share of [ingroup: Republican/Democratic] climate scientists emphasize that responding to climate change is about protecting American families, communities, and the economy – values shared by most [ingroup: Republicans/Democrats]. More and more [ingroup: Republican/Democratic] scientists are recognising that safeguarding the environment is also about ensuring energy security, economic stability, and a healthy future for the next generation. This shift reflects a growing movement within the [ingroup: Republican/Democratic] scientific community to approach climate solutions through values that put Americans first”\",\"Climate scientists study the Earth’s climate to understand atmospheric processes and their effects on ecosystems. Their work spans diverse habitats, such as oceans, rivers, forests, deserts, and grasslands, and the species that inhabit them. Because the problems that climate scientists work with are very complex, collaboration with other types of scientists, such as mathematicians, zoologists, and marine biologists, is very common. \\n\\nFor example, mathematicians develop models and equations to simulate climate systems, analyze large datasets, and quantify prediction uncertainties. Zoologists track changes in species distribution, migration, and breeding patterns to assess which animals and habitats are most at risk. Marine biologists monitor ocean temperatures, acidity, and marine life health, providing data for predicting sea-level rise and ecosystem impacts.\\n\\nBy working together across these and other scientific fields, climate scientists aim to produce evidence-based knowledge on the Earth’s climate.\",\"I.

STIMULUS\\nIntervention page 1\\nPlease read the short text below carefully. It describes a real project in the United States. After reading, you will be asked to answer a few short questions in your own words.\\n\\nIntervention page 2\\n\\nCase 1\\nPredicting Floods Before They Strike\\nIn many parts of the United States, floods have become a very real and nearby threat. Heavy rainstorms that used to happen only every few decades now strike several times a year. Across states such as Texas, Kentucky, and Arizona, flash floods have swept through roads, homes, and schools with little or no warning. For many families, flooding is no longer something that happens “somewhere else” – it happens close to home.\\nTo help communities prepare, researchers at the University of Arizona’s Center for Applied Hydroclimate Sciences have created a new early-warning system that can predict extreme rainfall and flooding weeks in advance. Using satellite data, ocean temperatures, and atmospheric-circulation models, they identify patterns that signal when dangerous storms are likely to form. Their model has already helped emergency managers in the Southwest issue warnings earlier and take action to protect residents and infrastructure.\\nLead researcher Dr Hsin-I Chang explains that the team aims to provide earlier detection of extreme weather events so that people and local governments have more time to act. The same approach that first helped predict the devastating 2015 Texas floods is now being adapted for other regions, including Arizona and parts of the U.S. Midwest.\\nThanks to this work, scientists are helping prevent floods from becoming full-scale disasters – turning climate research into protection that can make a difference for communities this season and in the years ahead.\\n(Based on Littin, S. (2025, July 31). “Early Warning: Climate Model Predicts Extreme Rain and Floods Weeks in Advance.” Arizona Institute for Resilience. https://air.arizona.edu/news/early-warning-climate-model-predicts-extreme-rain-and-floods-weeks-advance)\\n\\nCase 2\\nDetecting Wildfires Before They Spread\\nIn many parts of the United States, wildfires have become a very real and nearby threat. Fire seasons that once lasted a few weeks now stretch across several months, and even regions that rarely burned before are now facing fast-moving blazes. Smoke and ash can travel hundreds of miles, turning skies orange and threatening people’s health far from the flames. For many families, wildfires are no longer something that happen “somewhere else” – they happen close to home.\\nTo help communities prepare, scientists from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and NASA are developing new early-detection systems that can spot wildfires minutes after they begin. Using satellite images, heat sensors, and artificial-intelligence models, these systems detect the first signs of smoke or fire and alert local emergency managers right away. Their work has already helped firefighters in several western states reach ignition sites faster and prevent small blazes from becoming major disasters.\\nResearchers are also improving forecasts that show where and when dangerous fire conditions are likely to develop. This gives park rangers, energy companies, and residents more time to clear vegetation, secure equipment, or plan evacuations before a fire starts.\\nThanks to this work, scientists are helping prevent wildfires from becoming full-scale disasters – turning climate research into protection that can make a difference for communities this season and in the years ahead.\\n(Based on DHS Science & Technology Directorate, “Technology to Reduce the Impacts of Wildfires,” 2025. https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-108161.)\\n\\nCase 3\\nForecasting Winter Storms Before They Strike\\nIn many parts of the United States, severe winter storms have become a very real and nearby threat. Heavy snowfall, freezing rain, and sudden cold snaps have caused power outages, road closures, and even loss of life. Events like the 2021 Texas freeze and the 2022 Buffalo blizzard showed that dangerous winter weather can strike almost anywhere. For many families, these storms are no longer distant events – they happen close to home.\\nTo help communities prepare, scientists at the National Weather Service and several U.S. universities are developing new forecasting systems that can predict blizzards and extreme cold days to weeks in advance. Using satellite data, radar observations, and high-resolution climate models, they identify patterns in the atmosphere that signal when and where dangerous storms are likely to form. Their work has already helped local authorities issue warnings earlier and protect residents and infrastructure before conditions worsen.\\nResearchers are also working with city planners and emergency agencies to translate forecasts into concrete actions – salting roads, securing power lines, or warning schools and hospitals in time to prepare.\\nThanks to this work, scientists are helping prevent winter storms from becoming full-scale disasters – turning climate research into protection that can make a difference for communities this season and in the years ahead.\\n(Based on Novak, D.R.

People often resist climate science not because they lack information, but because accepting climate science implies supporting policies they oppose. For example, Campbell and Kay (2014) demonstrate that individuals, especially conservatives, express doubt when solutions involve government regulation. Thus, distrust is affected by ideological threat rather than evidence.\\n\\nResearch shows that this threat is reduced when messages affirm core values. For example, Mason et al. (2024) show that framing climate action as patriotic and system-preserving increases belief in climate change. Similarly, Bain et al. (2012) find that linking climate action to economic development increases acceptance. Together, these studies suggest that climate skepticism decreases when climate information is presented in a way that affirms rather than challenges individuals’ worldview.\\n\\nOur intervention builds on these findings. Instead of appealing to environmental protection, morality, or urgency, the intervention highlights that profit-driven corporations and insurance companies rely on climate scientists’ work. Insurance companies use climate projections to price physical risk and decide which regions and sectors to insure. Because insurers lose money when they underestimate risk, they have a financial incentive to use only reliable, accurate information. Likewise, large corporations integrate climate projections into supply-chain decisions, site selection, and long-term planning. In recent years, many private-sector firms have recruited climate scientists to work in-house on risk modeling and financial planning.  Because climate science is politicized (Schrøder, 2023), showing that companies depend on climate scientists conveys a credibility signal that is not political.\\n\\nWhen an outside actor relies on experts, people infer competence and trust (Yuan et al., 2020). In this context, the private sector functions as an independent validator: their reliance signals competence and, by implication, integrity and openness. This approach is fully non-deceptive; it only reports how climate scientists’ work is currently used in real business decisions, and it is likely the strongest possible credibility cue for Republicans and Independents, since profit-driven organizations would not rely on climate scientists’ work unless it proved helpful.\\n\\nThe intervention is intentionally non-partisan. Instead, it frames climate scientists' expertise in the context of the private sector. This design should especially affect participants who are typically more hesitant to accept climate science (Campbell & Kay, 2014), as it removes an ideological threat. While the effect may be weaker among Democrats, based on theoretical assumptions, it is expected that trust will increase among Republicans and Independents.\\n\\nThe intervention is low-cost and easily scalable as the narrative can also be used in other formats (e.g., journalism) and does not rely on deception.\\n\\nWe ran a short pretest with 150 participants (75 with treatment and 75 in the control group) on Prolific. The pattern of results was in the expected direction for Independents and Republicans, although the test was underpowered and relied on 7-point scales (t(147.24) = 0.99, p = .32, 95% CI [−0.22, 0.65]).\\n\\nReferences\\nBain, P.

They are increasingly used by the private sector, where decisions have financial consequences.\\n\\nFor example, insurance companies rely on climate scientists’ projections when calculating premiums and assessing risks.

When people perceive scientists as belonging to an out-group rather than their own, scepticism toward their messages tends to increase, while trust declines. A recent meta-analysis (Fage-Butler, Ledderer, & Nielsen, 2022) shows that public scepticism arises when scientists are seen as having hidden motives rather than serving the public good, suggesting that mistrust reflects an in-group/out-group dynamic in which scientists are perceived as outsiders. \\n\\nAs a result, emphasizing that scientists serve the interests of ordinary people rather than those of distant elites may help strengthen public trust in science. The context of carbon inequality, defined by the disproportionate share of emissions produced by the wealthiest groups, offers a powerful opportunity to do so (Chancel, 2019). Carbon inequality makes visible who causes the most harm and who bears the consequences, revealing that the climate crisis is not equally shared but structurally driven by a small minority. However, public understanding of these inequalities remains distorted. Nielsen et al. (2024) and Köchling et al. (2025) find consistent misperceptions across countries including the United States, Denmark, Germany, Nigeria, and India: while people tend to estimate emissions from the lower half of the income distribution accurately or even overestimate them, they substantially underestimate those of the wealthiest groups. \\n\\nIn our intervention, tested for the first time, we use information about carbon inequality to reshape the relationship between scientists and the public by manipulating in-group and out-group dynamics. A total of 812 participants were recruited through Cloud Research Connect and randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the control condition, participants completed the 12-item trust in science scale that will also be used in the Megastudy. In the intervention condition, participants first viewed a short text accompanied by a carbon inequality chart, framing scientists as members of the public’s in-group, people who serve collective interests by exposing who pollutes, who profits, and who should contribute most to the transition. They then completed the same trust in science scale. Results show that this in-group framing intervention increased trust by approximately 3.5 percentage points compared to the control condition (M_control = 75.15, M_intervention = 77.87), t(810) = −2.00, p = .045, 95% CI [−5.40, −0.06].\\n\\nOur intervention is theoretically valuable because it bridges two previously separate areas: perceptions of inequality and trust in science. Although misperceptions of carbon inequality are well documented, little is known about how such information shapes perceptions of scientists or public trust. Our findings suggest that highlighting carbon inequality can strengthen trust in science. Practically, this approach is effective for three reasons. First, it directly counters climate misinformation by exposing who pollutes and who seeks to discredit science. Second, it shows that scientists work on behalf of people and justice rather than wealthy individuals. Finally, it is easily scalable, as organizations like Oxfam already communicate about carbon inequality and could readily integrate this framing.\\n\\nReferences:\\nChancel, L. (2022).

Intellectual humility involves recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge and being open to others’ perspectives (Porter et al., 2022). It has both intrapersonal aspects, such as awareness of one’s fallibility, and interpersonal aspects, such as respect for differing viewpoints, willingness to admit uncertainty and learn from new information. These qualities align closely with the norms of good scientific practice, where uncertainty and self-correction are essential for progress (Hoekstra & Vazire, 2021).\\nWhile scientists sometimes hesitate to express uncertainty publicly, fearing it may undermine credibility, empirical work suggests that communicating self-correction can enhance perceived trustworthiness, including perceived integrity, benevolence, and even expertise (Altenmüller et al., 2021; Hendriks et al., 2016). In the context of climate science, acknowledging complexity and uncertainty has also been linked to increased trust (Howe et al., 2019; Vaupotič et al., 2024).\\nKoetke et al. (2025) conducted four experimental studies, which showed that when scientists communicate with high intellectual humility (vs. low intellectual humility or control), U.S.-based participants reported higher trustworthiness (expertise, integrity, benevolence) as well as expressed stronger beliefs about scientist’s research. These effects were robust across the political spectrum and different scientific topics, including a sustainability-related one.\\nWe propose that explicitly communicating intellectual humility by a group of climate scientists, who acknowledge the limits of current knowledge, express openness to new evidence, and signal the collaborative nature of their work could increase perceived expertise, integrity, benevolence, and openness.\\nClimate scientists could incorporate humility-based communication in outreach activities or teaching.

The exact context and topic can depend on other interventions; here is an example:\\n\\nAs climate scientists, we spend a lot of time questioning our own ideas. It’s not that we enjoy being wrong — but we know that every mistake or unexpected result helps us understand the climate system a little better. Our goal isn’t to defend a single theory, but to keep improving our models so they reflect reality as closely as possible.\\n\\nSometimes, new data completely overturn what we thought we knew. For example, our early models underestimated the role of ocean currents in regulating temperature. When the evidence showed otherwise, we had to admit we were wrong and rebuild our assumptions from the ground up. That process was humbling, but it made our predictions far more accurate.\\n\\nNo one works in isolation.

The intervention targets three recurrent claims found in conservative media and policy commentary: (1) that climate scientists profit from government action on climate change, (2) that climate research receives excessive public funding, and (3) that climate policies benefit elites while burdening ordinary people.\\nThe intervention draws on recent work conceptualizing climate politics as status politics (Wetts, 2025), which argues that opposition to climate action is partly rooted in symbolic struggles over the perceived authority of educated elites. Distrust of scientists is often less about specific empirical claims and more about perceived violations of fairness, integrity, and accountability. Accordingly, the intervention does not attempt to persuade through abstract facts alone but instead aligns climate science with widely shared moral values of transparency, fairness, and responsible stewardship of public funds.\\nParticipants first respond to a brief set of questions that prime shared values of fairness, honesty, and transparency in public institutions. These items focus on integrity in the use of taxpayer money, the importance of accurate information in policymaking, and the need for accountability among powerful actors. The goal of this value activation is to foreground moral principles that participants view as important and to provide a lens through which they interpret subsequent information about climate science.\\nParticipants are then presented with a series of short statements reflecting common misinformation claims about the motivations of climate scientists (e.g., “Climate scientists are paid to support certain climate policies”). After rating their agreement, participants receive factual corrections and context. Each correction includes clear, empirically grounded information about how climate research is funded, the modest median salaries of environmental scientists, the volunteer structure of major scientific assessments, and the transparency requirements for federal and university grants. The intervention clarifies that large dollar amounts associated with initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act or the NOAA’s budget do not reflect direct spending on climate research. Rather, climate research represents only a small portion of broader environmental and energy programs.\\nResearch in political psychology and misinformation correction suggests that value-consistent framing can reduce defensive processing and ideological resistance (Feinberg & Willer, 2013; Motta et al., 2021). By pairing a values affirmation with interactive fact-checking and emphasizing transparency and shared fairness norms, this intervention aims to reduce affective distrust toward climate scientists and reframe climate research as a public good rather than an elite project. This intervention could be adapted for public communication campaigns, journalism, and science education to rebuild trust in climate science institutions. By emphasizing transparency and moral accountability rather than technocratic authority, it provides a model for depolarizing science communication in contexts where distrust stems not from misunderstanding but from perceived moral and status violations.\\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"We’d like to ask a few short questions about your values and beliefs. \\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\nHow much do you agree or disagree with the following statements?\\n\\nEveryone should be held to the same standards of honesty and fairness.\\nIt is important that taxpayer-funded programs show exactly how their money is spent.\\nBig money has too much influence on what gets researched. \\nSometimes people in powerful positions push certain ideas not because they’re true, but because they fit their political or financial interests. \\n\\n0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree.\\n\\n—page break—-\\nThank you for sharing your thoughts.\\nMany Americans care deeply about fairness, honesty, and transparency in public decision-making.\\n—page break—-\\nNext, you’ll answer a few questions about your beliefs and attitudes concerning climate scientists. \\n—page break—-\\n\\n“Climate scientists are paid to support certain climate policies.”\\n0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree.\\n\\n—page break—-\\n\\nCorrection: \\nThe median salary of environmental scientists is $80,060, which is comparable to other academic researchers in public universities. \\n\\nIn fact, earth and environmental science researchers working at public universities earn less on average than faculty in the economics, business and law departments. \\n\\nThis salary comes from their employers, which include universities, government agencies, and private companies. \\n\\nBut climate scientists are not paid by government agencies to propose policy solutions. \\n\\nIn fact, scientists who work on US National Climate Assessment are not paid at all for their contributions.

Framed as a message from an international consortium of climate scientists, it emphasizes intellectual humility as a shared professional ethic rather than an individual personal trait. The intervention’s core narrative of “We’re learning more every day” signals openness, collaboration, and credibility on behalf of science as a whole. By emphasizing intellectual humility at the group level, it normalizes transparency and self-correction as defining features of the scientific process. By acknowledging uncertainty, learning openly, and inviting dialogue, this approach humanizes scientists, fosters identification (“people like us who keep learning”), and invites public collaboration rather than passive acceptance to leverage practical mechanisms that directly strengthen trust. \\n\\nBackground\\nRecent work has emphasized the importance of intellectual humility of scientists — openly acknowledging uncertainty, limitations, and ongoing debate (Hoekstra & Vazire, 2021). This has been supported by recent empirical evidence from a series of studies, which shows that perceived intellectual humility of scientists as a group correlates with greater trust in scientists overall, stronger belief in anthropogenic climate change, and greater support for evidence-based policies such as vaccination and genetic modification (Koetke et al., 2025). Furthermore, describing a specific scientist as high (versus low) in intellectual humility increased their perceived trustworthiness, belief in their research, and willingness to follow their recommendations, regardless of the scientist’s gender or race (Koetke et al., 2025).  Complementing these findings, other recent work shows that when scientists acknowledge the limits of their disciplinary perspective when communicating policy options, it can attenuate the political polarization of trust in scientists and scientific findings (Post & Bienzeisler, 2024). Together, this evidence underscores the potential value of testing generalisable humility-based communication interventions in the climate science domain, where trust remains especially polarized.\\nAccordingly, our intervention aims to increase perceived intellectual humility of scientists by emphasizing that changing in light of new evidence is intrinsic to scientific progress, and that collaboration and credit-sharing are central to how science advances. The intervention is theoretically grounded in the Ability–Benevolence–Integrity (ABI) model of trust (Mayer et al., 1995). Intellectual humility can strengthen all three dimensions simultaneously: it enhances ability through signalling mastery of the scientific method through transparent acknowledgement of uncertainty, benevolence by shifting perceptions from elitist to collaborative, and integrity through openness about limits and evolving evidence.\\n\\nPractical application: \\nThe framing is conceptually powerful yet logistically simple. It can be deployed through existing communication channels, including press releases, interviews, educational campaigns, or social media statements from established climate science organizations. It offers a low-cost, high-impact way to strengthen trust in science at scale, making it both theoretically grounded and practically executable.\\nKoetke, J., Schumann, K., Bowes, S.

It’s an invitation to look closer, test harder, and keep learning together.\\n\\nScience works because it stays open to learning.

When new evidence emerges, we revise our understanding, share our data, and invite others to test our ideas – because accuracy matters, especially when people’s lives and livelihoods are at stake.\\n\\nEvery insight builds on the work of countless others: researchers, field experts, communities, and generations before us who asked hard questions of their own.\\n\\nThat openness to being corrected isn’t a weakness – it’s how scientists build trust in their findings.\\n\\nSo, bring your questions.

Over time, evidence showed that this strategy caused forests to become overcrowded and dry—making wildfires more severe, not less.\\nInstead of defending the old approach, climate scientists recognized they had more to learn. They listened to firefighters, tribal fire experts, and local communities, understanding that others held deep, place-based knowledge. Together, they developed controlled burn practices that reduce fuel build-up and protect homes, wildlife, and forests.\\nThis example shows that climate science isn’t a fixed story or a belief system—it’s a community of people continually learning, revising, and improving so communities can make better decisions, together\\nThis is what climate science looks like:\\n- Listen to the evidence\\n- Learn from others\\n- Acknowledge uncertainty\\n- Adapt to protect communities\\nWhat matters is that the scientists are willing to learn, adjust, and do better for the people who depend on them.“\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Tested before?\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"No\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Comment\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"If one of our interventions gets selected, we are happy to assist with providing associated images to accompany the text.\"]}]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"details-box\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Decision notes\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"- brick bobcat and giant gibbon are quite similar and we think should be merged;

These endorsements may serve as trust bridges, helping skeptical audiences view climate science as objective and reliable rather than politically motivated. \\n\\nTheoretical basis: \\nIn the context of climate science, most people cannot directly evaluate complex models or datasets. Instead, they can look for costly signals that others have already vetted the evidence. When actors such as insurance firms, reinsurance companies, or long-term investors integrate climate projections into billion-dollar decisions, they send a signal: they are staking material resources on the accuracy of the science.\\nPersuasion depends on both the perceived expertise and the trustworthiness of the communicator (Source Credibility Theory; Hovland & Weiss, 1952). Climate scientists are seen as highly expert, yet their trustworthiness can be undermined by polarized media framing that paints them as politically motivated. Conversely, entities like insurers, central banks, or defense agencies are trusted precisely because they are viewed as apolitical and financially cautious. When such actors rely on climate data to inform billion-dollar decisions, they effectively lend “borrowed credibility” to climate scientists, validating their work from an unexpected and trusted quarter.\\nThis mechanism also draws on Signaling Theory (Spence, 1973): actors who commit substantial resources based on climate models demonstrate belief in their validity. The costly nature of such signals e.g., insurers pricing in sea-level risk, communicates sincerity more powerfully than verbal advocacy. Recipients interpret these signals as independent verification of climate scientists’ accuracy and objectivity.\\n\\nPrior evidence:\\nTrust in climate science does not arise from scientists alone but from a broader ecosystem of communicators. Cologna et al. (2024) show that while climate scientists are generally trusted, they are not the most trusted sources among all audiences, particularly among politically conservative groups, who express greater trust in figures like primary-care doctors and television weather forecasters. Scientists are “just one component in a larger communication ecosystem”.\\nSimilarly, Varda et al. (2024) argue that sustaining trust in science depends on a network of “stewards of trust” including policymakers, journalists, and civic institutions who collectively reinforce scientific credibility. Their study finds that participants value endorsement from independent actors on scientific findings, emphasizing that no single voice can maintain public confidence in science.\\n\\nPractical application: \\nThe intervention can be deployed by adapting authentic statements from insurers, defense agencies, or financial regulators. These messages already exist in public reports, press releases, and news coverage, making content generation inexpensive and automated. Brief narrative or headline-style messages (e.g., “Global insurer adjusts premiums based on climate projections”) can be integrated into educational materials, fact-checking platforms, or climate information portals. Because the approach works through exposure to credible, apolitical actors rather than persuasion from climate scientists themselves, it can be repeated across diverse contexts without message fatigue. This makes it suitable for wide, low-cost rollout through social media ads, government communication campaigns, or collaborations with journalists and industry partners.\\n\\nReferences:\\nCologna, V., Kotcher, J., Mede, N.

We believe this increase in trust will occur due to correction of misperceptions regarding climate scientists.\\n\\nAttacking experts through character assassination is a key aspect of climate obstructionism commonly used by contrarians to undermine scientists and policymakers (Coan et al., 2021). Such attacks can be particularly damaging when aimed at scientists’ competence or integrity (Barnes et al., 2018). We aim to help restore this trust in climate scientists by exposing the documented history of deliberate disinformation and deception by the fossil fuel industry, including their attempts to discredit climate scientists. There has been limited exploration of discrediting misinformation sources in climate communication, despite fossil fuel companies’ documented history of deliberate deception (Franta, 2021; Merner et al., 2025; Supran & Oreskes, 2017). Fossil fuel companies were a key part of climate research in the 1950s-80s (Franta, 2018; Brulle et al., 2019) with scientists at one company predicting global warming with high levels of skill and accuracy (Supran et al., 2023). Starting in the late 1980s, however, the fossil fuel industry devised a public relations campaign to stop action on climate change. The result was two decades of propaganda perpetuated by fossil fuel interests and their third party allies, which entailed denying climate science and slandering climate scientists (e.g., Cook et al., 2019; Oreskes & Conway, 2011). \\n\\nPublic opinion data suggest that exposing fossil fuel deception increases support for accountability, with surveys by Data for Progress (2023), Center for Climate Integrity (2023), and Hart Research (2016) showing consistent belief shifts after participants learn of the companies’ historical deception. These findings indicate public receptivity to source-based framing, in contrast to the dearth of media coverage that the fossil fuel industry’s history of malfeasance has received (Hertsgaard, 2021; Kalhoefer, 2015). We believe that this exposure of fossil fuel deception - particularly the slander of climate scientists - has the potential to increase trust in climate scientists by correcting misperceptions surrounding these scientists.\\n\\nIn our intervention, we explicitly refute and elaborate (Kendeou & O’Brien, 2014; Kendeou, 2024) on the role of fossil fuel companies in slandering climate scientists. We highlight fossil fuel companies’ violations of dimensions of perceived trustworthiness (Besley et al., 2021) such as their dishonesty (integrity), concealment of research (openness), funding false experts (competence), and profit-seeking over public welfare (benevolence). In turn, we aim to increase perceptions of climate scientists’ integrity and competence by refuting claims of scientists’ research misconduct and lack of expertise as well as inoculate against the strategies used by climate obstructionists.\\n\\nSuch an intervention could be deployed in real-world settings such as refutational social media videos, news articles, documentaries, and other public engagement efforts concerning the history of fossil fuel deception. Insights from our work might also help inform effective climate communication more broadly - for example, by scientific organizations, nonprofits, and policymakers.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Some people think that climate scientists cannot be trusted. You’d be forgiven for feeling that way, because the fossil fuel industry has bankrolled a multi-decade propaganda campaign specifically designed to undermine the public’s trust in climate science and scientists. Don’t let oil companies mislead you: trust the climate scientists, not the vested interests that have tried to discredit them. \\n\\nIn reality, oil companies have known for over 60 years that their products can cause global warming. In the 1970s and 80s, oil companies employed climate scientists, conducted climate science research, and agreed with academic and federal scientists that burning fossil fuels would lead to climate change. But instead of alerting the public or taking action, the fossil fuel industry did the opposite: they (1) attacked climate science and scientists, (2) lobbied politicians against climate and clean energy policies, and (3) spent billions of dollars on advertising propaganda while raking in record profits. Their goal was to stop action on climate change by undermining the public’s trust in climate science and scientists.\\n\\nOil companies knew.\\nOver the past decade, historians and journalists have discovered internal memos from oil companies showing that the oil industry has known since the 1950s that their products could cause dangerous climate change. By 1959–more than 60 years ago–they knew that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming “sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York.” During the 1970s and 80s, scientists at one oil giant predicted global warming with breathtaking accuracy and warned executives of “potentially catastrophic” climate effects. Oil companies employed and worked with many of the world’s top climate scientists. \\n\\nOil companies lied.\\nDespite the fossil fuel industry’s early knowledge of climate science and early work with climate scientists, oil companies spent the next two decades misleading the American public with a well-funded disinformation campaign that denied the reality and severity of human-caused climate change. Their goal was to confuse the public and policymakers in order to delay action and protect profits. To do so, the oil industry and its allies manufactured a false debate about climate change in order to undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and human-caused. The fossil fuel industry’s internal memos made this propaganda strategy explicit: “Emphasize the uncertainty” in climate science and “Reposition global warming as theory (not fact).” \\n\\nAttacking climate science.\\nAs part of this attack on the scientific consensus, oil companies issued statements and advertisements claiming that climate science was “unsettled”, which was incorrect. They also funded a small but vocal group of contrarian scientists and fake experts to create the false illusion that “independent experts” disagreed with mainstream scientists. \\n\\nAttacking climate scientists.\\nClimate scientists themselves also became the victims of an orchestrated smear campaign. For example, when one world-renowned climate scientist coauthored a major report concluding that human-caused global warming was underway, he was publicly accused of fraud and corruption by an oil-industry front group. When another prominent climate scientist coauthored research confirming rapid global warming over the past century, he was harassed for years by bogus legal complaints filed by organizations funded by fossil fuel interests. \\n\\nLobbying politicians against climate and clean energy policies.\\nBetween 2000 and 2016, oil interests spent $2 billion lobbying Congress against climate change legislation. They outspent environmental groups by 10-to-1.\\n\\nSpending billions of dollars on advertising propaganda.\\nFrom 1986 to 2015, five oil companies alone spent $3.6 billion on advertising.\\n\\nBig Oil is the new Big Tobacco. It can’t be trusted.\\nThe oil industry’s tactics came straight out of the playbook used by tobacco companies: sabotage the science and slander the scientists. In the process, the American public has been denied the right to be accurately informed about and protected against climate change, just as they were denied the right to be informed about the dangers of smoking by the tobacco industry. When it comes to climate change, don’t trust the oil companies, trust the climate scientists. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBrulle, R.

In this rational impression account, people are impressed by scientific discoveries, which leads them to trust scientists, but then they quickly forget the knowledge that had impressed them. The rational impression account is grounded in cognitive science studies that have shown: \\n\\n(i)\\tThat people are good at identifying impressive knowledge (things that few people know) and that they deem people who have such knowledge more competent (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976251339633)\\n(ii)\\tThat people tend to think that consensual information (such as well-established scientific discoveries) is accurate, and the people who generated the information are competent (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027724002919) \\n(iii)\\tThat people remember well gist memories (e.g. whether someone is competent), while they tend to forget the verbatim information that led to that gist (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1041608095900314)\\n\\nThe account and its empirical backing are described in this pre-print: https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/nwka2_v1.\\n\\nThe effect of impressive science has been directly tested in the cases of archeology and entomology: providing participants with impressive discoveries in these fields made participants more likely to think of archeologists and entomologists (respectively) as competent and trustworthy (in press, see https://osf.io/preprints/osf/argq5_v2). Moreover, participants promptly forgot almost all of the information they had found impressive. Although there is no formal recipe for generating impressive information, manipulation checks have shown that the texts meant to be impressive were indeed deemed to be impressive.\\n\\nWe have recently conducted a pilot experiment applying the same method to climate scientists. Texts highlighting climate scientists’ range of activities and discoveries, the difficulty of their task, and their past successes have led to much higher levels of trust in climate scientists, with overall increases of approximately 12 points (out of a 100) on each of the four broad measures of trust (competence, benevolence, integrity and openness) (by comparison with a text unrelated to climate science). More specifically, a text designed to be very impressive had similar effects than a text that was more descriptive, but which turned out to have also been deemed very impressive. Both texts were non-significantly more effective than a text designed to elicit gratitude towards climate scientists. The results can be found at this link https://janpfander.github.io/impressive_climate/ \\n\\nIf the suggested intervention is successful, it could be applied in real world settings for instance by suggesting that journalists and science communicators spend more time communicating about the actual science of climate science—how climate scientists understand, measure and predict the climate—instead of mostly its consequences for the world or for policy.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Climate scientists are researchers who study the Earth’s climate system — the intricate web of interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surfaces, and living organisms that together regulate the planet’s temperature and weather patterns over time.\\n\\nTheir main goal is to understand how these components influence one another and how they have changed throughout Earth’s history. To achieve this, climate scientists rely on a wide range of evidence. They analyze long-term temperature and precipitation records collected from weather stations around the globe, satellite data that monitor variations in sea surface temperatures and polar ice cover, and natural archives that preserve traces of past climates.\\n\\nTo understand the climate of the distant past, scientists drill deep into the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to extract ice cores — cylinders of compacted snow and ice that can record hundreds of thousands of years of environmental history. Each layer of ice corresponds to a specific year of snowfall, and these layers can be dated using several techniques, such as identifying volcanic ash deposits. Each eruption leaves a distinct chemical fingerprint that allows researchers to assign precise ages to different layers. Once dated, the ice cores are analyzed for the tiny air bubbles they contain, which hold ancient greenhouse gases like CO₂ and CH₄, while the isotopic composition of the surrounding ice reveals past temperatures.\\n\\nClimate scientists work in a variety of environments — from remote polar research stations and deep-sea expeditions to data laboratories and climate modeling centers. Their studies often focus on large-scale phenomena such as glaciations, droughts, monsoon cycles, or ocean-atmosphere interactions like El Niño and La Niña, which strongly affect weather patterns around the globe.\\n\\nIn parallel with reconstructions of past climates, climatologists continuously monitor the modern atmosphere through a global network of CO₂ observatories and satellites like NASA’s OCO-2. By analyzing how carbon dioxide absorbs sunlight at specific wavelengths, they can precisely measure its concentration in the air — a level of sensitivity comparable to detecting a single drop of ink in an Olympic-size swimming pool.\\n\\nBy studying these processes, climate scientists are able to identify the mechanisms driving changes in the climate and predict their impact on ecosystems, sea levels, and human societies.

Social identity and value‐aligned communication theories suggest that when climate messages threaten people’s political or cultural identities, defensiveness rises and trust declines (Fielding et al., 2020). Conversely, messengers who embody shared values and ingroup identities can bridge divides and foster openness toward scientific information (Fielding & Hornsey, 2016; Hornsey & Fielding, 2017).\\n\\nBuilding on this principle, the emerging concept of “unconventional climate advocates”, such as farmers, military veterans, and religious leaders, highlights the persuasive potential of advocates who promote climate action from social identities not typically associated with climate issues (Colvin et al., 2025; Gulliver et al., 2025). Conventional environmentalist-identified advocates may be less trusted by some social groups like political conservatives (Ghasemi et al., 2025). By signaling shared identities and values, unconventional advocates may help sidestep partisan divides and frame climate science through more resonant frames. In doing so, the credibility attributed to these trusted ingroup messengers may extend to climate scientists who become viewed as partners rather than outsiders.\\n\\nWhy unconventional advocates are promising\\nEmpirical research supports the power of value-congruent and identity-consistent communication to increase trust and belief acceptance. Messages affirming conservative values of stewardship, loyalty, and responsibility enhance acceptance of climate science (Dixon et al., 2017), while faith-based framing activates moral and communal values that strengthen engagement (Goldberg et al., 2019). Unconventional advocates naturally embody these values. Military messengers, for example, have been shown to increase receptivity to climate information among right-leaning respondents (Motta et al., 2021), while “conservative conservationists” reconcile identity conflicts by reframing climate concern as moral duty rather than political allegiance (Diamond, 2024). Media analyses similarly find that unconventional advocates are perceived as more credible and less radical than conventional environmental NGOs (Gulliver et al., 2025). Collectively, this suggests a trust spillover effect, where credibility attributed to unconventional advocates may transfer to climate scientists.\\n\\nOur preregistered experiment (https://osf.io/p5ztq/overview?view_only=883f5907fe1c425a906362383e150911, manuscript in preparation) provides further supporting evidence. Rural and regional Australian participants exposed to information about unconventional advocates (e.g., Farmers for Climate Action, Australian Firefighters Climate Alliance, Australian Religious Response to Climate Change) reported higher climate concern, perceived responsibility, dynamic norms, and policy support than those shown conventional advocates (e.g., Greenpeace Australia Pacific and general climate advocacy groups); these effects were stronger among climate-skeptical and right-leaning participants.\\n\\nProposed intervention and real-world implications\\nThe intervention will present short vignettes randomly featuring a farmer, military veteran, or religious leader expressing climate opinion in value-congruent language as manipulation material (see below) for unconventional advocates. This approach aligns with existing initiatives such as the U.S. Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance, military climate networks, and the Catholic Climate Covenant. Demonstrating that such interventions can enhance trust in climate scientists highlights the potential of partnerships with unconventional advocates as climate messengers: an identity-bridging strategy that is theoretically grounded, empirically supported, and scalable for strengthening public engagement with climate science.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Manipulation materials\\n\\nKindly note that participants in this intervention condition will be randomly presented with information featuring either a military, farmer, or religious cue.

Ideologies further predispose people to distrust climate scientists, making skepticism normative within like-minded groups (2). For this reason, traditional social norm interventions – highlighting what others do and think in a static manner – often fail to shift climate beliefs or spur action (3).  \\n\\nThe emergent concept of dynamic norms, however, provides a promising alternative to enhance trust in climate scientists. Rather than statically describing ‘what others do and think’, dynamic norms emphasise change – how public attitudes or behaviours have evolved over time. Perceiving such change triggers two cognitive processes: anticipating a different future and assigning greater relevance to the behaviour (4). Together, these processes foster attitudinal and behavioural change. \\n\\nThe intervention draws on shifts in public sentiment toward climate scientists’ integrity and competence, as evidenced by two PEW Research Centre surveys (5,6). Findings from these surveys show that the proportion of U.S. citizens who strongly trust climate scientists to provide accurate information about climate change increased from 39% in 2016 to 54% in 2022. Theoretically, trusting somebody to give accurate information reflects perceptions of that person’s competence (are they able to provide accurate information?) and integrity (will they tell the truth?). By making participants aware of this positive trend, our intervention leverages dynamic norm mechanisms and aims to strengthen trust in climate scientists.\\n\\n\\nWhy the intervention is effective \\nPrevious research provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of dynamic norm interventions across countries; even beyond traditional normative interventions (3,4). By showing participants a trend of growing trust in climate scientists, they are likely to (a) anticipate a future where such trust is the norm and (b) perceive higher trust in climate scientists no longer as impossible, but as achievable and important. This perceptual shift is likely to increase personal trust in climate scientists. \\n\\nHow it could be applied in real-world settings\\nOur intervention can be applied across all climate communication settings – from reports and media outlets to public speeches and social media. Because it draws on real-world data, it also tests the persuasive power of ‘actual research’ to increase trust in climate scientists. \\n\\n\\nReferences\\n1.\\tMayer RC, Davis JH, Schoorman FD.

This intervention is based on previous research that stresses the impact of certain beliefs about scientific disciplines on laypeople's trust in them. Laypeople display a bias or preference for numeric information and visual depictions of numeric data, even when this information is irrelevant (Eriksson, 2012; Godau et al., 2016; Newman & Scholl, 2012). People have greater respect for, and trust in, sciences that are perceived as being number/math-oriented, which makes them feel more precise (Broomell & Kane, 2017; Pfänder & Mercier, 2025). In previous research by our group (under review), we provide further evidence for this: a) when the public organizes sciences in their mind, they do so based on whether the discipline is more or less quantitative, and b) the more quantitative a discipline is, the more scientists working in that discipline are perceived as capable, benevolent, and honest (which in turn fuels public support for funding that discipline). While the public certainly recognizes the reliance on quantitative methods by climate scientists (our data shows that, in general, natural sciences are thought about that way; see also e.g., Gligoric et al., 2022), this association may not come spontaneously to mind when people think about climate science and climate scientists. Rather, people may focus on their beliefs that climate scientists are biased and self-interested in pushing a certain political agenda instead (Cologna et al., 2024). The goal of this intervention is to turn people's attention to a characteristic of climate science (i.e., being a quantitative discipline) that is associated with higher trust in scientists. We believe that this intervention would work exactly because previous work (our research; Broomell & Kane, 2017) has already established that perceiving a discipline as more quantitative increases support for science and trust in it. To bolster the potential of this intervention, the concrete materials additionally include statistical jargon, which is functionally similar to how numerical information has been used in previous research (see Eriksson, 2012). Jargon has been shown to increase satisfaction with explanations and ascriptions of expertise to scientists (Cruz & Lombrozo, 2025). Furthermore, this is a relatively minimal intervention that can be deployed in many contexts. For example: Scientists can stress that their findings are based on quantitative methods and data when interacting with skeptical audiences, in order to increase perceptions of their expertise. In fact, our data show exactly that this number-orientation dimension is particularly apt at changing the beliefs of those who are more skeptical of science (and climate science in particular) -- conservative individuals -- probably because perceiving a discipline as quantitative increases perceptions of its certainty (to which this group is particularly sensitive; Broomell & Kane, 2017). This intervention is scalable and can be used as a way for science communicators to establish their credentials based on empirically-validated dimensions that have been shown to foster trust in scientists (and in its many sub-facets, concretely).\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Climate science follows a standardized set of rules and procedures that all scientists defer to when producing scientific knowledge. Naturally, most people who are not experts in climate science may not be aware of this rigorous scientific method that is used by climate scientists. Next, we will briefly describe this method:\\n\\n“Though people might not think of climate science as a science like other sciences, it relies on the same quantitative methods, using mathematical data. Climate science translates natural phenomena into numerical information and analyzes observable patterns in order to estimate probabilities and make forecasts about these natural phenomena.\\nWhen conducting their research, climate scientists first collect vast amounts of data using meticulous instruments, such as satellites or ocean buoys. All of this numeric data is quite precise in the way it captures the properties or elements of natural phenomena under study. For example, ocean buoys can measure sub-surface temperature, water chemical composition, or barometric pressure.\\nAfter collecting these raw data, climate scientists analyze them using sophisticated algebraic operations. They develop statistical models and computational simulations based on mathematical equations with multiple parameters. Among many other techniques, climate scientists may analyze their data with spatial interpolation, support vector machines, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, or spectral and wavelet analysis. These statistical analyses are quite complex, and therefore climate scientists rely on high-performance computing systems to estimate parameters that could not be calculated manually. \\nSo, for example, if climate science research finds that \\\"urban areas face heightened vulnerability to heatwaves and flooding\\\", this conclusion is merely the description of the information embedded in the data collected and subsequent analyses. To arrive at this conclusion, climate scientists would collect data in urban and non-urban areas and then compare them. They could, for example, track temperature exceedance thresholds and quantify rainfall anomaly indices or atmospheric moisture content, as well as register the characteristics of the areas themselves, such as the soil's evapotranspiration or hydraulic conductivity. They would then incorporate all this information into the models and analysis strategies described in the previous paragraph to arrive at a numeric quantification of the extent to which urban and non-urban areas are at risk for heatwaves and flooding, before statistically comparing the magnitude of these values.\\nThe quantitative focus of climate science ensures that it produces rigorous and reliable knowledge that is reproducible by other scientists. Ideally, this helps policymakers inform their decisions on empirical evidence - that is, on quantifiable measured patterns -, rather than on their subjective discernment.”\\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Tested before?\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"No\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Comment\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Feel free to reach out to me in case you need further information about our unpublished research in order to assess the promise of the intervention.\"]}]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"details-box\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Decision notes\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"- this intervention could benefit from changes: simplifications in scoring system and revising the benevolence questions\\nthe scoring is not really transparent - how has it been decided to which categories specific items pertain, and why do some items yield two instead of only one point for certain categories?;\\n-  the benevolence question is about policyand potentially revise scoring\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Intervention content\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"climate scientists personality quiz (which type of scientist are you?)\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Reviewer comments — reviewer 1\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"This is a really creative idea - due to ins quite specific format, scalability is limited (but good suggestions are made).

Each scenario presents four response options reflecting trustworthiness dimensions. Participants receive a personalised profile (e.g., \\\"The Transparent Communicator,\\\" \\\"The Rigorous Sceptic\\\") highlighting shared values with climate scientists. This intervention builds on three theoretical cornerstones:\\nSocial Identity Theory & Common Ingroup Identity Model (Tajfel & Turner, 1979, 1986; Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000): \\nThe quiz facilitates recategorisation by transforming perceptions from \\\"us vs. them\\\" to an inclusive \\\"we\\\" (Gaertner et al., 1993). By discovering shared values with climate scientists, participants develop a common ingroup identity, for example, as \\\"people who value rigorous thinking.\\\" This recategorisation reduces intergroup bias and increases trust (Dovidio et al., 1998), serving as social identity affirmation that improves perceptions of scientists (Nauroth et al., 2015).\\n\\nPerspective Taking & Self-Other Overlap (Galinsky et al., 2005; Batson et al., 1997):\\nScenario-based questions prompt participants to adopt the perspectives of climate scientists. Perspective-taking increases self-other overlap, i.e., the mental merging of self and other (Davis et al., 1996), generating empathy and prosocial motivation. Self-other overlap mediates the relationship between perspective-taking and empathy (Cialdini et al., 1997; Myers & Hodges, 2012), potentially enhancing perceived benevolence and openness.\\n\\nImagined Intergroup Contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009; Turner et al., 2007): \\nThe quiz simulates mental contact through role-taking scenarios. A meta-analysis of over 70 studies found imagined contact reduces intergroup bias (d+ = 0.35) across attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behaviour (Miles & Crisp, 2014), mediated by reduced anxiety and increased trust (Turner et al., 2010).\\nImplementation: Participants encounter 6 scenarios covering key trustworthiness dimensions, for example: \\n\\nIntegrity: “You find an error in your published study. What do you do?” \\nOpenness: “Someone criticises your research online. How do you respond?” \\nBenevolence: “Policymakers ask if they should implement climate action. What do you say?” \\nCompetence: “Your data shows a trend but isn't 100% certain. How do you proceed?” \\n\\nEach response is scored on the underlying dimensions. The quiz should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Participants then receive one pre-written profile that (1) names their “scientist-type”, (2) describes demonstrated values, (3) explains how climate scientists embody these values, (4) uses affirming language emphasising commonalities, and (5) optionally includes a real climate scientist example to enhance personification. \\n\\nThis intervention targets all outcome dimensions, especially integrity, benevolence, and openness. By creating identification through shared values discovery, the quiz should enhance trustworthiness perceptions and function similarly to cooperative quiz games that reduced partisan animosity (Woodley et al., 2025). The non-threatening format should avoid reactance while facilitating perspective-taking and fostering a common identity. Effects should persist as participants internalise commonalities as self-generated insights. Furthermore, this intervention has a low threshold for user-centred interactions, as it can be easily applied to real-world applications - for example, as an AR filter on social platforms like TikTok or an interactive online quiz.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Temporary Questions/Scenarios \\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: Handling Uncertainty (Competence)\\n\\\"Your data shows a trend but isn't 100% certain.

You're convinced people make good decisions when given proper information.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists work hard to make findings understandable without oversimplifying. They share uncertainties openly because they respect that people deserve the whole truth. Just like climate scientists, you also don't hide the uncertainties - you explain. Climate scientists publish data, methods, and doubts transparently because trust is built through openness, not perfect answers.\\n\\nProfile 2: \\\"The Rigorous Sceptic\\\"\\nHighest scores: Competence + Integrity + Openness\\nYour values: You take accuracy seriously and only trust well-evidenced information. You ask critical questions to ensure conclusions are truly sound. Acknowledging mistakes is strength, not a weakness.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists are professional sceptics. Their job is questioning theories, searching for errors, and only claiming what they can demonstrate. They undergo intensive peer review where experts try to find weaknesses - because thorough criticism leads to better results. When they discover errors, they publish corrections because scientific integrity comes first. That's your standard too.\\n\\nProfile 3: \\\"The Principled Guardian\\\"\\nHighest scores: Integrity + Competence + Benevolence (balanced)\\nYour values: You aren't swayed by external pressure and stand by what's right - even when uncomfortable. You believe truth and integrity matter more long-term than short-term advantages, whilst still wanting to help.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists face enormous pressure from political camps, interest groups, and funders. Yet they report results as data show them, not as others wish. They develop strict ethical standards to protect independence because trust is based on principles. Integrity is non-negotiable.\\n\\nProfile 4: \\\"The Collaborative Realist\\\"\\nHighest scores: Benevolence + Openness + Competence\\nYour values: You believe in collaboration's power and that best solutions emerge when perspectives unite. You share generously, listen carefully, and want your work to help others make informed decisions.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate research is an enormous collaborative project. Thousands of scientists share data, check each other's work, and build upon one another because complex problems require joint efforts. They work with economists, sociologists, engineers, and policy experts because findings are only valuable if they help others decide better. Their research serves the common good - like your values.\\n\\nProfile 5: \\\"The Balanced Professional\\\"\\nHighest scores: All dimensions relatively equal (within 20%)\\nYour values: You find balance between requirements. You're thorough but pragmatic, open but protective of quality, clear but responsible in communication.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists constantly navigate complex trade-offs: How to communicate uncertainty without being misunderstood? How to remain independent whilst funding research? How to share worrying findings without exaggerating or downplaying? Like you, they make daily decisions balancing different values. They're neither naive idealists nor cynical opportunists - they're realists doing work with integrity whilst operating in a complex world. That's your balanced approach too.\\n\\nProfile 6: \\\"The Methodical Scientist\\\"\\nHighest scores: Competence + Integrity (Openness/Benevolence lower)\\nYour values: You take responsibility seriously and want to ensure you never cause harm. You prefer caution, thorough checking, and clear boundaries. Care matters more than speed.\\nWhat connects you with climate scientists: Climate scientists carry enormous responsibility - findings influence policies affecting millions. That's why they take accuracy seriously. They've developed strict protocols, multiple checks, and conservative estimates because they understand their work's consequences. They recognise limits, saying \\\"This is my expertise\\\" and \\\"This is outside my field\\\" because responsible action means knowing where competencies end. Their caution isn't weakness - it's strength based on responsibility.\\n\\nProfile 7: \\\"The Isolated Sceptic\\\"\\nHighest scores: All dimensions predominantly negative\\nYour values: You tend to prioritise self-protection and caution above collaboration and transparency. You may feel that sharing information or admitting uncertainty makes you vulnerable, so you prefer to keep things close to your chest.\\nWhat separates you from climate scientists: Climate science thrives on openness, collaboration, and intellectual honesty - values that might feel risky to you right now. But climate scientists weren't born with these values; they learned them through practice. These are learnable skills. Every scientist has faced moments of wanting to hide errors or ignore criticism. The difference is they've built practices that support doing the harder, more honest thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScoring\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate dimension totals\\nIntegrity: Sum all Integrity scores from Q1-Q6\\nCompetence: Sum all Competence scores from Q1-Q6\\nOpenness: Sum all Openness scores from Q1-Q6\\nBenevolence: Sum all Benevolence scores from Q1-Q6\\n\\nStep 2: Identify top 2-3 dimensions (highest scores)\\n\\nStep 3: Assign Profile According to Top Dimensions\\n\\nOpen + Ben + Int (all high) = Transparent Communicator\\nComp + Int + Open (all high) = Rigorous Sceptic\\nInt + Comp + Ben (balanced, Int highest) = Principled Guardian\\nBen + Open + Comp (Ben/Open highest) = Collaborative Realist\\nAll within 20% of each other = Balanced Professional\\nComp + Int high, Open/Ben lower = Methodical Scientist\\nMostly negative; all dimensions low = Isolated Sceptic\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Tested before?\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"No\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Comment\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"We are open to any feedback and possible changes!\"]}]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"details-box\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Intervention content\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"explains peer-review process\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Reviewer comments — reviewer 1\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Promising\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Reviewer comments — reviewer 2\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"It is very similar to other interventions I reviewed.

According to social influence theory (Kelman, 1953), people tend to adopt beliefs or attitudes that are endorsed by credible others, especially recognized experts. Research consistently shows that consensus among experts increases perceived accuracy and reliability of scientific claims (Lewandowsky et al., 2013). Empirical evidence suggests that emphasizing the expert consensus on climate change significantly increases belief in climate science and support for climate policy (van der Linden et al., 2016).\\n\\nHowever, many people remain unaware of how scientific peer review actually works. Peer review aims to be a clear and credible signal of both expertise and accountability, as it demonstrates that climate research is scrutinized by independent specialists before being accepted. Making this process salient should increase perceived credibility of climate scientists, as it frames their claims as products of collective expert review rather than individual opinion. The intervention also addresses another common source of distrust: the misconception that climate scientists act in isolation or are driven by personal or political motives. By foregrounding the collaborative and self-correcting nature of peer review, it highlights that trust in climate science is trust in a transparent, expert-driven process, not in individual personalities. At the same time, however, highlighting the rigorous peer review process of climate science also reinforces perceptions of individual-level researchers' competence.\\n\\nThis intervention could be implemented in public communication campaigns, educational settings, and news media to increase understanding of how scientific credibility is established. For example, short explainer posts, museum exhibits, or infographics could present how climate studies undergo rigorous peer review before publication. Media outlets could reference this process when covering new climate findings to reinforce trust. In digital contexts, platforms that share scientific information, such as social media pages of research institutions or research journalist outlets could use similar messaging to emphasize the expert assessments underlying climate research.\\nBy making the peer review process visible and relatable, this intervention aims to strengthen the perception that climate science is trustworthy because it is based on systematic expert evaluation, not individual belief. This framing aligns with decades of research showing that perceived scientific consensus and procedural transparency are among the most effective predictors of public trust in science.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Every day, scientists around the world make discoveries. But before those discoveries are shared, they face one of the toughest tests in any profession: peer review. This means that highly proficient experts, often even direct competitors, carefully examine the research to see if it holds up. They check whether the evidence is solid, whether the reasoning makes sense, and whether the results truly support the conclusions. If they find any problems, the study must be revised or rejected. Only after passing this tough test, the work is accepted as part of the scientific record. It’s a process designed to catch errors, make sure the science is solid, and move knowledge forward\\nPeer review is the foundation of scientific trust. It shows that science is not based on individual opinion, but on collective expert judgment. In effect, it is scientists holding each other accountable to the highest standards of accuracy and honesty.\\nClimate science works exactly this way. Every credible study on climate change has been reviewed and approved by multiple independent experts. This means the findings you hear about—rising global temperatures, shifting weather patterns, melting glaciers—are not just one researcher’s claim. They represent the shared evaluation of specialists who have been trained to become experts in understanding the planet.\\nWhen experts across the world examine the same evidence and consistently reach the same conclusions, that agreement is powerful proof. It tells us the science is solid and that trust in climate scientists is justified.\\nPeer review is what turns individual research into collective understanding. It is the reason scientific progress is reliable. Peer review is why climate science deserves your confidence.\\nFor most studies in climate research: \\n✅ The science was double-checked.

By shifting perceptions of climate scientists from “outsiders with an agenda” to “community members working for shared goals”, the intervention activates a sense of common values and shared purpose and could reduce the psychological distance between climate scientists and the public. Participants are shown a brief, text-and-image module, highlighting climate scientists working alongside local residents—such as farmers, firefighters, and emergency planners—to protect homes, land, and community safety. The examples portray scientists as community members who work together with the local population to protect it and care about the same priorities as everyone else: family, home, preparedness, and stewardship of local environments. Finally, participants are asked to reflect on ways scientific work has benefited their own community, encouraging internalization without persuasion. The goal is to shift perceptions of climate scientists from distant or ideological to familiar, collaborative, and prosocial.\\n\\nTheoretical reasoning\\nDrawing on the Common Ingroup Identity Model (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), this intervention aims to frame scientists as part of the same in-group by highlighting shared values (family, work, community safety, and stewardship) and presenting them as relatable, benevolent, and community-oriented individuals. It has been argued that appeals to broadly shared values could increase trustworthiness perception of scientists (Cologna et al. 2024). \\nA set of correlational and experimental studies has further shown that perceived prosocial motives of scientists are linked to higher trust (Benson-Greenwald et al., 2021), thus emphasizing that scientists are community-oriented and care for the greater good could also be a promising strategy in the climate domain. Another mechanism through which this intervention has the potential to be effective is humanization, which may address the perception of scientists as distant or impersonal by emphasizing warmth – an essential dimension of trust (Fiske & Dupree, 2014; Philip-Muller et al, 2022).\\n\\nReal-world applicability\\nThis intervention could be used by public libraries, science museums, universities, and local emergency preparedness programs to build trust in climate science by highlighting shared values and community collaboration. It is also well-suited for social media platforms (e.g., Facebook pages, local government Instagram accounts, YouTube explainers, or short TikTok/Reels videos). Because the intervention focuses on scientists' prosocial motives and role as fellow community members, rather than climate messaging or persuasion, it can be adopted in rural, suburban, and urban outreach contexts to strengthen trust in science across diverse audiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\nBenson-Greenwald, T.

An innovative line of work in communication theory and epistemology proposes an alternative model: trustless communication. Rather than seeking to increase trust through moral or emotional appeal, trustless communication aims to reduce the need for trust by designing interactions and systems that are verifiable, transparent, and procedurally accountable. This approach builds on the idea that reliance can be established through visible mechanisms of scrutiny, analogous to “trustless” systems in computer science and blockchain governance, where cooperation is ensured through decentralization, risk reduction, and confidence-maximizing rules rather than faith in individual actors.\\nThe current intervention is among the first empirical tests of this emerging theoretical framework. It examines whether trustless communication strategies, by demonstrating that scientific processes or scientists themselves are not demanding trust but instead enabling verification, can nonetheless produce higher measured trust in climate scientists. In other words, the intervention investigates whether making trust unnecessary also makes it easier.\\nIn both proposed versions, the message replaces affective appeals (“trust us, we are experts”) with risk-reducing and certainty-maximizing procedural or informational transparency (“you can verify our expertise and review criteria yourself”). One version focuses on trustless process: it is presented as an actual call by a hypothetical climate science journal inviting public feedback on its peer-review procedures, while describing how reviewer lists, qualifications, evaluation criteria, and decision timelines are made publicly accessible. Ideally, this could be modeled on a real scientific journal. The second version focuses on trustless individuals, where a collective of climate scientists calls for public feedback on their planned study, detailing their research plan and demonstrating that their funding sources, data, and peer-review histories are openly documented and verifiable. In both cases, the core mechanism is not persuasion through authority but confidence through inspectability.\\nWe expect that this trustless strategy will increase perceived competence, expertise, and openness, while also signaling benevolence indirectly through a willingness to be held accountable. Although the trustless framework is designed to function without requiring interpersonal or institutional trust, it acknowledges that trust may nonetheless be advanced through it — specifically by satisfying the same psychological needs for predictability and control that underlie trust judgments (Mayer et al., 1995; Lewicki et al., 2006).\\nBeyond theoretical novelty, this approach is highly applicable to real-world climate science communication. Scientific institutions, journals, and data repositories increasingly face public demands for transparency and accountability. Implementing verifiable disclosure mechanisms - such as open peer-review ledgers or public researcher registries - could strengthen confidence in science without relying on contested narratives about scientists’ intentions or moral integrity.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Call for Public Feedback: Improving the Transparency of Climate Science Peer Review\\nFrom the Editorial Board of Climate Methods Review\\nAs part of an ongoing effort to strengthen the quality and openness of climate research, Climate Methods Review is introducing several updates to its peer-review process.

Participants engage in a brief, live text-based conversation with an LLM embedded in the survey. The LLM begins mildly skeptical about climate scientists and asks the participant to explain why they should be trusted. Over the course of 2–3 brief exchanges, the participant responds to polite yet critical questions. In the final message, the LLM acknowledges that the participant's arguments were convincing. The task lasts less than five minutes and does not store participants' typed responses. The purpose is engagement and self-persuasion, not response analysis.\\nCrucially, participants aren't asked to state false beliefs or pretend to be skeptics themselves. Instead, they adopt a discussion position (like in a debate club) where they advocate for trusting climate scientists, regardless of their personal views. This framing lets participants engage intellectually with the arguments without requiring them to misrepresent their own stance.\\n\\nBackground\\nThis intervention draws on self-persuasion theory (Aronson, 1999), which shows that creating arguments in support of a position strengthens the speaker's own attitudes. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) explains the underlying mechanism: by actively generating arguments to convince a skeptical AI, participants engage in central-route processing. The debate task creates high motivation through personal relevance and advocacy, while the structured exchanges provide sufficient cognitive ability to process arguments systematically. This deep elaboration may promote increased trust in climate scientists.\\nFurther, the LLM's mild skepticism introduces a controlled challenge, applying Inoculation Theory (Compton, 2025). Exposure to weak counterarguments, followed by successful refutation, increases resistance to future persuasion attempts against trusting climate scientists. By recalling prior knowledge to construct arguments (Gurlitt & Renkl, 2010), participants activate and strengthen existing mental associations with climate science credibility.\\nThe live conversational format simulates a dialogue that promotes active recall, encourages elaboration, and helps participants integrate climate science knowledge into coherent, persuasive reasoning.\\n\\nImplementation\\nThe LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude) is embedded in Qualtrics via a custom HTML/JavaScript chat interface that connects to the model through a secure proxy server.\\nThe conversation runs live inside the survey, with the system prompt controlling tone and content to ensure mild skepticism, openness to persuasion, factual accuracy, and avoidance of offensive material. No participant messages are stored. Interaction is capped at 2-3 exchanges to keep duration within five minutes, after which the LLM provides a positive closing message reflecting that it has been convinced.\\n\\nSummary\\nThis intervention uses a live, interactive LLM to elicit active persuasion from participants. By convincing a skeptical but responsive AI, participants engage in deeper cognitive processing, rehearsing and consolidating reasons for trusting climate scientists, which theory predicts will strengthen trust attitudes in a lasting way. This intervention is highly scalable and could be integrated into educational settings such as online courses or climate literacy modules, where students consolidate their understanding through active argumentation, or deployed in public engagement campaigns on climate organization websites and social media platforms.

It also enables people to own up to these limitations and seek to update their knowledge base (Leary et al., 2017; Whitcomb et al., 2017). Intellectually has been associated with a wide range of cognitive and social outcomes including reduced dogmatism, increased open-minded thinking, increased perspective-taking, and enhanced compromise-seeking behaviors (Porter et al., 2022). Of particular relevance to this proposal, recent works have found that intellectually humble people tend to have more trust in science and scientists, and tend to be less skeptical of climate change (Huynh et al., 2025; Ploh & Musil, 2023). However, no work has examined whether an intellectual humility intervention can increase trust in climate scientists specifically. \\n\\nRecently, Knöchelmann and colleagues (2025) conducted an intervention tournament pitting five intellectual humility interventions against each other (explanatory depth, growth mindset, a humility information text, listing unknowns, and self-distancing). They found that providing a text about the benefits of intellectual humility for improving conversations over different political topics was most effective at enhancing intellectual humility across the different controversial topics examined. This finding extends previous work on the effectiveness of this intervention for improving people’s efforts for mastery-focused learning (Porter et al., 2020). Critically for this proposal, this intervention has been demonstrated to be effective in short, online-based studies (i.e., taking less than 2 minutes to complete). \\n\\nThis is a relatively straightforward and simple intervention with huge upside potential for application in real-world settings. For example, relatively simple reminders about the benefits of intellectual humility prior to engaging with climate scientists and climate research can help increase trust in the researchers and their research. For instance, this text could be posted on websites and media where people go to get information about climate science. \\n\\nAll in all, given intellectual humility’s ability to predict increased trust in science/scientists and decreased trust in climate skepticism this validated intervention has high potential to be an effective strategy for increasing trust in climate scientists. \\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"How do you communicate successfully in different discussions?\\n\\nRecent social-psychological research shows that recognizing the limits of one’s own knowledge is crucial for constructive dialogue.

This proposal adapts insights from our previous research to offer new climate communication solutions to declining trust in climate scientists; \\\"reversal narrative messaging.\\\" \\n\\nReversal narratives tell the stories of people who once held positions at odds with scientific consensus, but opted to change their minds. In theory, these messages work by establishing trust between messengers and skeptical audiences. Psychologically, people tend to place higher levels of trust in messengers who share their views, which (in a source credibility framework) in turn increases receptivity to persuasive messaging attempts [1-2]. \\n\\nOur past research provides an evidentiary basis for the effectiveness of reversal narrative messaging. For example, in both controlled experiments and quasi-experimental settings, we found that former vaccine skeptics who regret not vaccinating (e.g., due to getting seriously sick) can significantly increase vaccination intentions in vaccine hesitant subpopulations. [3-4]\\n\\nHowever, efforts to apply reversal narrative messaging to climate change contexts -- and trust in climate scientists in particular -- are lacking. While our previous research has explored the impact of related counter-stereotypical climate messaging on ACC acceptance (e.g., when groups with climate-denying reputations make pro-ACC arguments) [5], we are unaware of previous efforts to employ the \\\"skeptics who saw the light\\\" strategy to promote trust in climate scientists. \\n\\nReversal narrative messaging in climate contexts could take the form of highlighting the stories of people who have lost their homes due to extreme weather events, experienced negative health outcomes associated with increasing average global temperatures, and much more. Unfortunately, real-world accounts of stories like this are plentiful. \\n\\nIn this submission, I propose to randomly assign survey respondents to read a true and lightly edited story (involving NO deception) about a former climate skeptic -- Meteorologist Jennifer Rukavina, from Kentucky. The passage (<200 words) details how a the meterologist (a self-identified Republican) did not like what she saw as \\\"political theatre\\\" around climate science. However, she decided that she would not \\\"let politics dictate what is good science.\\\" She changed her mind about climate change after \\\"hearing from scientists themselves,\\\" and uses her new perspective to take an active role in preparing her community for \\\"the challenges that lie ahead.\\\" \\n\\nThis manipulation does not involve deception (it is a lightly edited news interview), and should in theory increase multiple domains of trust: as the story draws on themes related to benevolence (using climate science to protect Rukavina's community), openness (as Rukavina is a former skeptic), and competence (Rukavina is herself a meteorologist). \\n\\nThis study should also be sufficiently powered to detect experimental effects. Our previous reversal narrative work typically recovers effects of about 12 percentage points; which a study of this size can detect with power levels exceeding 90%. While I expect the reversal narrative message to have population-wide effects, a N = 1,000 should also be sufficiently large to study partisan asymmetries in message acceptance.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

In the early 2000s, when Ms. Rukavina began her career, Al Gore, the former vice president and climate change activist, had just released his film “An Inconvenient Truth.” The split among her colleagues, Ms. Rukavina said, was largely focused around the political “theater” surrounding the film, which experts often describe as a flash point in the deepening partisan divide on climate change.\\n\\n“I decided that I needed to educate myself, because the meteorologist is often viewed as the station scientist,” Ms. Rukavina said. In 2008, she attended her first Glen Gerberg Weather and Climate Summit — a meeting of weathercasters and climate scientists — in Colorado. After hearing from the scientists themselves, Ms. Rukavina said, she changed her mind.\\n\\n“I am a registered Republican, but I don’t let politics dictate what good science is to me,” she said. Every year since, Ms. Rukavina has briefed her WPSD viewers live from the conference. “It really doesn’t matter to me what my viewers think of climate change,” she said. “What matters to me most is being able to prepare them for the changes that lie ahead.”\\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Tested before?\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"No\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Comment\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"If desired, I am happy to further randoizde whether respondents are (vs. are not) exposed to language noting Rukavina's partisan identity.

Particularly for issues such as climate change, which is increasingly linked to sociopolitical identity questions about air travel or meat consumption, a perceived mismatch of people’s and scientists’ political ideologies is a main driver of low public trust in scientists (2). This is especially salient in the US, where two major parties offer conflicting answers to these questions, contributing to what has been conceptualized as “affective climate polarization” (3). Affective climate polarization conceives “climate attitudes as expressions of social identity and group affiliation” and has arguably deepened a cleavage between segments of the population with high and low trust in climate science, with cleavage edges mapping well onto Democrat vs. Republican partisan agendas (4).\\n\\nA promising lever to maintain public trust in climate scientists across the entire population is therefore to reduce affective climate polarization. This necessitates a depoliticization of climate science, so as to decouple public perceptions of scientists from political ideology. However, there is no work that translates this rationale into an actionable climate depoliticization intervention. We propose such an intervention that features the following key elements described in the conceptual literature on depoliticization and depolarization (e.g., 5–7). The intervention contains (a) bipartisan source cues, (b) quotes by opinion leaders, (c) references to the non-political norms of science, (d) mentions of non-partisan quality indicators, e.g. academic awards, and (e) focus on multiple dimensions of trust, e.g., competence, benevolence, integrity, and openness. \\n\\nThe proposed text-based vignette (first draft) combines these elements in a brief news article. It may help recipients perceive climate science as a non-partisan endeavor, where scientists’ expertise, benevolence, integrity, and openness are not contingent upon their perceived political orientation. If successful, it can inform science communication efforts (e.g., solutions-based science journalism) and political communication (e.g., campaigns bridging partisan gaps). Overall, this intervention lives up to recent calls for more inclusive and equitable science communication that benefits the entire population, as it seeks to foster trust across all groups of the public and not only the distrustful.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n1.

This message addresses this challenge by redefining what good science looks like and positioning scientists as the solution to reducing uncertainty. \\nLike the previous intervention, this message acknowledges uncertainty upfront and materializes the benefits of transparency through concrete actions: “share their methods publicly, invite peer review.” However, it employs two additional mechanisms.\\nFirst, the message reframes uncertainty as a positive professional norm. Rather than treating uncertainty as a red flag that undermines scientists' credibility, the message explicitly recasts it as “how good science works” and links it to “integrity and rigor.” This norm reframing changes how audiences interpret scientist behavior. Instead of viewing uncertainty acknowledgment as evidence of incompetence or deception, the message establishes a new evaluative standard: good scientists should admit uncertainty because that's what the scientific method requires. The phrase “share their methods publicly, invite peer review” reinforces that openness about uncertainty is the professional norm in science, not an exception or failure. Research on scientific norms shows that when audiences understand transparency and peer review as standard scientific practices, they interpret uncertainty acknowledgment more favorably (Merton, 1973; Anderson et al., 2010).\\nSecond, the message signals competence by positioning scientists as the solution to reduce uncertainty. The phrases “update their forecasts as new data emerges” and “willingness to refine their work” followed by “helps reduce uncertainty and gets us closer to the reality” create a clear progression: scientists identify uncertainty, then actively work to close the gap toward truth. This framing accomplishes two things. It signals that science is a learning process rather than a static body of facts, the only reliable path to reality. More importantly, it establishes expert researchers as essential guides who possess the skills and methods to reduce this uncertainty over time. By emphasizing what scientists do to address uncertainty (measure it, update forecasts, refine methods), the message demonstrates active competence. \\nThis framework works especially well when explaining why forecasts change or when addressing skepticism about scientific consensus shifts. It's valuable in science education to establish correct expectations about how knowledge develops, and in policy communications when explaining model updates. Science organizations can use this message to train researchers to frame uncertainty acknowledgment as professional duty while emphasizing their unique capability to reduce that uncertainty through systematic methods. By positioning scientists as both honest about current limits and uniquely equipped to overcome them, the message transforms uncertainty from a credibility liability into an opportunity to demonstrate both integrity and problem-solving competence.\\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Climate forecasting involves uncertainty.

Participants estimate what percentage of scientists agree with several factual statements—three representing high consensus (“Human activities are the primary cause of global warming,” “Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet”, “Smoking causes lung cancer) and one reflecting ongoing scientific refinement (“Doubling atmospheric CO₂ will warm Earth by 3 °C”). After each estimate, participants receive immediate corrective feedback summarizing the actual level of expert agreement and explaining how those conclusions arise from multiple, independent lines of evidence.\\nThe design integrates three well-supported psychological mechanisms: \\n1) Prediction–Correction Learning. Having participants generate an estimate before revealing the correct answer increases cognitive engagement and facilitates belief updating (Kornell et al., 2009; Metcalfe & Finn, 2012). Active prediction prompts deeper processing and reduces defensiveness when presented with corrective feedback (Ecker et al., 2017; Guess et al., 2020). \\n2)  Communicating high expert agreement increases acceptance of scientific conclusions by signaling competence and evidential strength (Lewandowsky et al., 2013; van der Linden et al., 2015). Trust in climate scientists depends strongly on perceived consensus and legitimacy, which this intervention makes salient through repeated, quantified exposure to expert agreement. \\n3) Transparency About Uncertainty. The inclusion of a partially uncertain item demonstrates the integrity of scientific inquiry. Howe and colleagues (2019) show that transparently communicating uncertainty increases trust in scientists and message acceptance. This intervention thus reframes uncertainty as evidence of rigor and openness, not weakness.\\nTogether, these elements address both cognitive and affective bases of trust: competence (scientists know what they are doing), integrity (scientists are honest about limits), and warmth or benevolence (scientists work transparently in the public interest).\\nTheoretical and Empirical Value\\nThis intervention builds on prior work in science communication by embedding consensus information within an active prediction–correction framework that simultaneously highlights the transparency and self-correcting nature of science. Rather than simply presenting facts, participants actively test their assumptions against empirical reality, experiencing firsthand how scientific agreement and uncertainty coexist. By combining this prediction–correction format with clear information about expert agreement, it leverages evidence that perceived scientific consensus is causally linked to acceptance of climate science. Finally, by including a partially uncertain item, the intervention applies findings that transparently communicating uncertainty increases trust in scientists and message acceptance. Together, these mechanisms provide a concise, theory-driven test of how active learning, consensus perception, and transparent uncertainty can jointly strengthen trust in climate scientists.\\nReal-World Applications\\nThe format is brief, text-only, and scalable across online, classroom, and media contexts. Governments, museums, and educational platforms could adapt it as an interactive “Guess the Consensus” feature, allowing the public to test their intuitions about scientific agreement across topics. Beyond climate change, the same framework can correct misperceptions and strengthen trust in science on issues such as vaccine safety, air pollution, or nutrition research—where understanding both consensus and uncertainty is key to informed public decision-making.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Science advances through an ongoing process of testing, refinement, and discovery. In some areas, evidence is so strong that scientists reach near-universal agreement. In others, uncertainty remains as researchers continue to collect data and improve models. This uncertainty is not a weakness but a fundamental part of how science progresses. Through careful methodology, replication, and continual evaluation, scientists build confidence in their conclusions. \\n\\nNow we would like you to make estimations about scientific certainty.

This conclusion comes from many independent lines of evidence: satellite temperature records, ocean-heat measurements, retreating glaciers, and physical models of the atmosphere. The agreement exists because multiple methods point to the same result, not because of any single study.\\n\\n2)Nearly all climate scientists — over 99.99 % — agree that rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the planet to warm. This rests on well-tested physics: CO₂ traps heat that would otherwise escape to space. The effect has been confirmed in laboratory experiments, atmospheric observations, and computer simulations that reproduce past climate changes. The consistency of results across so many approaches shows how robust this finding is.\\n\\n3)Climate scientists agree that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will warm Earth, but they don’t all give the same exact number for how much. Most studies place the likely range between 2.5 °C and 4 °C, with about 75 % of experts identifying around 3 °C as the central estimate. These estimates come from an iterative process: scientists build models based on physics, test them against real-world data, publish results, and invite others to re-analyze or challenge them. When new evidence appears—like better satellite readings or improved cloud modeling—forecasts are updated. That cycle of testing, questioning, and self-correction is what makes scientific understanding more reliable over time.\\n\\n4)Virtually all medical and public-health scientists agree that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer. This conclusion comes from decades of independent studies showing that smokers are many times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers. Evidence from epidemiology, laboratory research, and clinical trials all point to the same cause–effect relationship.\\n\\nAttention check: Which statement had the least scientific consensus?

Motivated reasoning and self-affirmation theories suggest that perceived threat to identity or worldview reduces openness to corrective information. Providing a psychologically safe opportunity for participants to articulate their concerns before receiving balanced, respectful feedback can lower this threat.\\n\\nProcedure\\nParticipants are first asked to briefly list one or two reasons why some people (or they themselves) might not fully trust climate scientists. After typing their response, they are presented with a short, text-only conversation with an LLM chatbot embedded in the survey.\\n\\nThe chatbot (using pre-defined prompts, no adaptive fine-tuning) performs three actions:\\n\\nAcknowledges the participant’s concern respectfully (“That’s a reasonable question; many people wonder about this”).\\nResponds with accurate information addressing the concern (e.g., transparency of funding, replication, open data).\\nConcludes reflectively, highlighting shared goals between scientists and the public (“Building trust is a two-way process, and scientists aim for openness and honesty”).\\n\\nThe total duration is under five minutes. The dialogue content will be fixed and identical in structure for all participants, with wording varying only if the concern mentions partisan or identity-relevant cues (e.g., providing examples of scientists from the participant’s political ingroup).\\n\\nWhy this may be effective\\nEvidence from recent megastudies and conversational experiments shows that personalized yet non-argumentative interactions can reduce polarization and increase trust (Abdel-Aal et al., 2024; Bruneau & Saucier, 2022). This design extends those findings to the domain of climate science. By letting participants articulate their reasoning first, the intervention activates self-generated cognition rather than passive exposure—an approach known to foster attitude updating and durable belief change.\\n\\nReal-world applicability\\nIf effective, this approach could be scaled easily in online communication campaigns by universities, science communicators, or governmental agencies.

Physicists, chemists, and biologists tend to be highly trusted, whereas climate scientists are considered less trustworthy by the general public (Gligorić et al., 2024). This is notable since the vast majority of the scientists who study the Earth’s climate system have a disciplinary background in the natural sciences, most commonly in atmospheric physics, geochemistry, oceanography, and biology. Here, we argue that messages that describe the field of climate science and explicitly mention natural science disciplines that contribute to this research field could have the potential to increase public trust in climate science.\\n\\nScientific disciplines can be considered as attitude objects, just like political parties, candidates, or issues. When two attitude objects are considered simultaneously, this can give rise to contrast or assimilation effects (Herr et al., 1983). Assimilation effects tend to emerge when two attitude objects seem to belong to the same category or are perceived as being closely related (Bless & Burger, 2016). The information that is made accessible through the confrontation with one attitude object (prime) is then used to form a mental representation of the second attitude object (target) (e.g., inclusion/exclusion model, Schwarz & Bless, 1992). \\n\\nWhen messages highlight the natural science disciplines that contribute to climate science, an assimilation effect could emerge: the attributes that laypeople commonly associate with the natural sciences, for example high competence and assertiveness (Gligorić et al., 2024), are then also associated with climate science. As a result, climate scientists may then seem more competent and assertive. These are crucial facets of trust (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995). It could therefore be assumed that exposure to messages that describe the field of climate science and highlight natural science disciplines that contribute to this research field may change how climate science is perceived. \\n\\nThis intervention can be implemented in the form of a short text. The text briefly describes the field of climate science, focusing on aspects such as research objectives and methods used in this field. Importantly, the text emphasizes that the scientists who are studying the Earth’s climate system are primarily natural scientists with backgrounds in atmospheric physics, geochemistry, oceanography, or biology. Several leading climate scientists are mentioned in the text. Their disciplinary background is made salient (e.g., “physicist James Skea”, “geoscientist Katherine Calvin”, “geochemist William Schlesinger”). It is also explained that climate models incorporate general physical and chemical principles in order to simulate climatic processes. This underscores the foundational role of the traditional natural sciences in climate research. \\n\\nIf this simple intervention proves successful, the practical implications could be considerable. Science communicators may then be encouraged to highlight the natural science disciplines that contribute to climate science whenever they discuss insights from climate research in public settings. \\n\\nReferences:\\nGligorić, V., Van Kleef, G.

The belief that scientists are fundamentally different from “people like me” can undermine trust, particularly among groups already skeptical of scientific authority (Gligorić et al., 2025). Social identity theory and research on intergroup perceptions suggest that trust in experts increases when those experts are perceived as members of one’s ingroup or as psychologically close (Tajfel & Turner, 1986; Nauroth et al., 2016). Even minimal cues of similarity can increase warmth and perceived benevolence, and thereby potentially increasing perceived competence (Fiske et al., 2007). Experimental evidence demonstrates that portraying scientists as relatable rather than elite increases trust (Beauchamp et al., 2022).\\n\\nWe propose a “Relatable Scientist Mapping” intervention in which participants read a short profile of a climate scientist whose background cues are tailored to reflect aspects of the participant’s own background. Using demographic information already collected (region, age group, education, and political orientation), the profile presents the scientist as sharing everyday experiences and values with the participant. For instance, a participant from the Midwest will read about a scientist who grew up in the Midwest, while a participant in their 20s will encounter a scientist early in their career. This subtle identity alignment might reduce perceived distance and increases ingroup overlap.\\n \\nThe recategorization approach aims to increase trust by enhancing warmth-related trustworthiness dimensions and reducing perceptions that climate scientists belong to a distant elite. Competence may increase indirectly as warmth facilitates positive global impressions (Fiske et al., 2007).\\n\\nThe intervention uses broad, non-sensitive demographic mapping, does not involve deception, and mirrors naturally occurring forms of science communication (e.g., podcast interviews). If effective, this simple narrative technique provides a scalable, realistic tool for science communication: presenting climate scientists as ordinary community members who happen to study climate, rather than as remote experts. Highlighting relatable identities and values may offer a promising path to strengthening trust in climate science.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"I.

This interview is from a podcast that talks with people whose work affects daily life, from doctors and teachers to emergency managers and scientists. \\nThis episode featured a climate scientist who works with communities across the U.S. to help prepare for weather-related risks. Please read the short transcript below. Afterward, we will ask you a few questions about what you’ve just read.\\n\\nIntervention page 2\\nTranscript: Interview with Dr. Alex Smith\\n \\nHost: Today we’re talking with climate scientist Dr. Alex Smith. Thanks for joining us.\\n \\nAlex: Happy to be here.\\n \\nHost: Your work looks at weather and communities. How would you explain what you do?\\n \\nAlex: I study extreme weather, so things like heat waves, heavy rainfall, storms, and I work with local officials, schools, and emergency teams so people have clear information to plan and stay safe. A lot of the job is translating forecasts into something useful for everyday decisions.\\n \\nHost: What put you on this path?\\n \\nAlex: I {{EDUCATION_PHRASE}}. Over time, I realized how much weather shapes daily life, from power bills and farming to school schedules and outdoor work. {{POL_PHRASE}}. Climate work let me apply that in a practical way, where better information helps a community prepare and avoid harm. \\n \\nHost: Did where you grew up influence your interests?\\n \\nAlex: Definitely. I {{REGION_PHRASE}}. You pay attention when storms roll in or there’s a long dry stretch; and you see how neighbors depend on each other. Those experiences made me appreciate how closely weather and community life are connected.\\n \\nHost: What’s a typical week like for you?\\n \\nAlex: It varies. Some days I’m analyzing weather patterns; others I’m on calls with local planners or emergency managers. Outside the job, I {{AGE_PHRASE}} — I cook, spend time with friends, follow local sports, and get outside when I can. Pretty normal stuff. \\n \\nHost: What keeps you motivated?\\n \\nAlex: When someone says a warning helped them prepare, or kept older relatives safe during a heat wave, that really matters. Science can be quiet work, but if it helped protect a family or kept a community running, that’s enough for me.\\n\\nIntervention page 3\\nThanks for reading the interview transcript.

Direct persuasion however can result in defensive responses, which diminish the success of a possible intervention (e.g., Liberman & Chaiken, 1992). Prevailing theories indicate that information against behaviours or cognitions can be overtly confrontational and give people the impression that their 'freedom to choose' is threatened, which leads to the experience of psychological reactance, and can even increase the behaviour or cognition at question (Brehm & Sensenig, 1966; Grandpre, Alvaro, Burgoon, Miller, & Hall, 2003). Researchers have found that compared with passively accepting a persuasive message, self-persuasion (i.e., generating own arguments against a behaviour/cognition by answering questions) is a far more effective method for changing smoking behaviour and decreasing smokers' defensive responses towards persuasive messages (e. g., Glock et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020; Loman et al., 2018). Thereby, generating few arguments seems to be more effective than generating many arguments (Müller, et al., 2017). To be specific, self-persuasion increases people's self-referential processes, they come up with arguments important to themselves, and change not only their attitudes towards a topic, but also more importantly change behaviour. It is thus an intervention which can be tailored to people as they provide the persuasive message themselves. By doing so, resistance can be avoided as the freedom to choose is not threatened. I think in your context, it is theoretically valuable to include as not much is known about how effective self-persuasion is when the topic is less important to people. Above mentioned studies mainly focussed on relevant topics (i.e., smoking and drinking behaviour, or healthy eating). Trust in scientists might be less obviously relevant to participants. \\nMy proposed intervention is thus to simply ask participants what valid reasons they have to trust climate scientists and write up the three most compelling arguments for them to do so vs. think about the question and answer it in one’s head without writing it up. Ideally, in a control condition would also write up arguments about a certain/related topic. But often, participants in the control condition read information (as this is what is normally done in real-life). \\nSuch an intervention is also easily applicable: messages to trust scientists could be formulated as questions. Receivers think about the message even if not writing up an answer (Li et al., 2020).\\n\\n\\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"writing condition: Please note the three most compelling arguments you have to trust climate scientists.

In recent years, science communicators have repeatedly made references to the long history of climate research. On social media sites, photographs of old newspaper articles have been circulating that show that scientists had already identified human-caused global warming as a potential threat in the early 1900s. Here, we argue that highlighting the historical foundations of climate research could be an effective strategy to increase trust in climate science, particularly among conservative audiences. \\n\\nPsychological research has shown that people exhibit a tendency to associate longevity with goodness and validity (longevity heuristic; Eidelman et al., 2010). This tendency has been documented in numerous experimental studies and across various domains, from attitudes towards medical treatments to aesthetic judgments of art (e.g., Eidelman et al., 2010; Eidelman & Crandall, 2012). Shedding light on the long history of climate science could therefore change how this discipline is perceived. When people learn that major insights from climate science date back hundreds of years and have stood the test of time, this could make the discipline seem more trustworthy. \\n\\nThis effect could be particularly strong for conservatives. Studies show that conservatives are more likely than liberals to use longevity as an indicator for goodness and validity (e.g., Blanchar & Eidelman, 2021). Conservatives tend to prefer the past over the present; they are more nostalgic and less open to new ideas (e.g., Lammers & Baldwin, 2018). The notion of ‘traditional science’, conducted by academic pioneers in laboratories with analog instruments, may thus be particularly appealing to conservatives. Furthermore, highlighting the long history of climate science can help to clarify that climate change is not a concept that emerged in today's polarized political climate. This could make it more difficult to dismiss climate change as a \\\"hoax\\\" or \\\"political propaganda”. \\n\\nIt could therefore be helpful to communicate that the foundations of modern climate research were already laid hundreds of years ago. This information can be conveyed through a short text. The text provides a brief overview of the history of climate science, highlighting important milestones in the field. The text stresses that climate research dates back a long time, with some groundbreaking discoveries being made more than 150 years ago. For example, it is mentioned that the natural greenhouse effect was already discovered in the mid-19th century. The text describes how these past discoveries are still relevant today, to illustrate that key insights from this field have stood the test of time. Readers are presented with several images that make the text more engaging. Portraits are shown of pioneers of climate research such as John Tyndall and Guy Callendar. In addition, readers may be presented with newspaper headlines from the early 1900s which show that scientists have already been aware of the possibility of human-caused climate change at that time. \\n\\nThis intervention can be used in educational settings (e.g., school textbooks, museum exhibits, science centers/ columns). \\n\\nReferences:\\nEidelman, S., Pattershall, J., & Crandall, C.

The first temperature records began in England in the 1640s. Around the same time, scholars started to examine trade winds and monsoon systems. \\n\\nThroughout the 19th century, our understanding of the Earth’s climate system improved significantly. In the 1850s, physicists Eunice Foote and John Tyndall discovered the natural greenhouse effect. They found that certain gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. This finding stimulated further research on how the composition of the atmosphere affects Earth’s climate. By the end of the 19th century, researchers began to consider the possibility that human emissions of greenhouse gases could cause global temperatures to rise.\\n\\nIn the 20th century, advancements in technology and systematic measurements led to new discoveries. In 1938, physicist and engineer Guy Callendar found that increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were associated with rising global temperatures. This finding was later supported by geochemist Charles Keeling’s precise measurements of atmospheric CO2 starting in 1958. The Keeling Curve, as it is known, illustrates the steady rise of CO2 levels and remains a cornerstone of climate science. \\n\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the emergence of high-performance computers allowed scientists to develop dynamic models of the Earth’s climate system. The results from these models aligned with previous findings: our climate is warming because of human greenhouse gas emissions, which have changed the composition of the atmosphere considerably. \\n\\nThe climatological knowledge we rely on today is far from new—it builds on hundreds of years of meticulous observation, experimentation, and analysis.

We draw on evidence that trust in expertise of an agent is a function of the quality of past advice received from that agent (e.g., Twyman et al., 2008). In the case of climate scientists, we suspect that a key indicator of quality of past advice is the accuracy of climate models in prediction of future changes in the climate. Indeed, the perceived low accuracy of the data and computer models used by climate scientists has been shown to relate to poorer trust in climate scientists. This finding was observed in interviews with climate sceptics in the US (Sarathchandra & Haltinner, 2020), analyses of blog posts (Matthews, 2015), or a correlational survey in Australia (Tranter et al., 2023). \\n\\nThe proposed intervention entails asking the participants to read an adapted version of a real news article from Science attempting to answer the question of how well climate models as old as from the 1970s were able to predict actual development of the climate thereafter (Cornwall, 2019). If such early and simple models were accurate, this should serve as an important and easy-to-understand indicator of the quality of the underlying competence of climate scientists. Indeed, the article reports a study finding that the predictions of aggregate temperature changes were largely accurate both in direction and quantity. We adapted the article for easier comprehension and greater disclosure of uncertainty, an important principle of evidence communication (Blastland et al., 2020), acknowledging that while the accuracy of aggregate temperature changes are high, some models were also somewhat off and other changes such as exact locations and intensities of consequences of climate change are more difficult to predict. Communicating uncertainty was previously shown to enhance trust, for instance in the context of Covid-19 vaccinations (Petersen et al., 2021), a similarly polarized topic.\\n\\nWe expect that the short version of this intervention, i.e., simply stating that “even 50-year-old climate models correctly predicted global warming” may be an effective and easy to implement for climate communicators both in written and spoken format as a quick and simple potential way of raising the credibility of climate scientists. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBlastland, M., Freeman, A.

Because climate science has existed for many decades by now, we set out to see how well past models predicted what is happening right now.\\n\\nClimate scientists first began using computers to predict global temperatures in the 1970s. These early models were simple compared to today's supercomputers, but a recent extensive review of 17 different forecasts made between 1970 and 2001 found a surprising result: most of them were remarkably accurate.\\n\\nSince 1970, global average surface temperatures have risen by approximately 0.9 degrees Celsius until 2019. This study found that for many of the older models, their predicted warming was not statistically different from what actually happened. They correctly predicted the direction and, for the most part, the quantity of the temperature increase.\\n\\nWhere Were the Models Off? \\n\\nA few models did predict warming that was slightly too high or too low—by up to 0.1 degrees per decade. This is where the crucial nuance comes in: The small errors were mostly due to incorrect predictions about human behavior, not a flaw in the fundamental physics of the models.\\n\\nClimate models require two main inputs:\\n1.\\tThe Physics: How the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land behave.\\n2.\\tThe human actions: How much pollution (greenhouse gases like CO2 but also cooling aerosols) humans will emit into the atmosphere over the decades.\\nIt turns out it’s incredibly difficult to predict our future pollution. For example, some models from the 1980s that initially looked \\\"too warm\\\" didn't factor in a steep, unexpected drop in planet-warming refrigerants, resulting from the success of the 1989 Montreal Protocol to repair the ozone layer. They also sometimes overestimated the release of other gases like methane.\\n\\nWhen researchers adjusted these older models to use the actual historical pollution levels (instead of the levels they originally guessed), the predictions from those models lined up almost perfectly with the temperatures we observe today.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThis doesn't mean climate models are perfect, nor that they can predict everything – for example, it is still very difficult to predict the exact location or intensity of extreme weather events. These topics are subjects of ongoing work with increasingly sophisticated methods. But this half-century of modelling history provides strong evidence that the fundamental science used by climate scientists to project future warming has been sound for decades. \\n\\nIt confirms that we have enough information to trust the core messages of climate models – which some of the brightest minds of our time are working on.\\n\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Tested before?\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"No\"]}]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"details-box\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Decision notes\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"- similar to flimsy fish; \\n- by contrast with flimsy fish, this one has not been tested before, and appears harder to read\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Intervention content\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"intellectual humility\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Reviewer comments — reviewer 2\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"It is a good appraoch and the intervention seems solid.

This is particularly salient when headlines highlight alarming projections—like record-breaking sea-level rise by mid-century—before later articles revising the numbers downward, or even reversing the direction, as new evidence emerges. This pattern, though reflecting the natural self-correcting process of science, can make the public perceive scientists as inconsistent, unreliable, or politically motivated. The proposed intervention addresses this trust gap by promoting epistemic humility as one cornerstone of credible science communication. It reframes humility not as hesitation or weakness, but as an honest acknowledgment that knowledge evolves—a signal that scientists are transparent, rigorous, and trustworthy precisely because they admit the limits of current understanding.\\nResearch on intellectual and epistemic humility suggests that individuals who openly recognize the provisional nature of their beliefs are perceived as more competent, sincere, and trustworthy (Porter & Schumann, 2018; Krumrei-Mancuso & Newman, 2020). In the domain of science communication, humility predicts greater perceived integrity and benevolence, especially when scientists explain why evidence sometimes changes (Koete et al., 2025; Steijaert et al., 2021). Studies on trust in science show that some people value honesty and openness even more than confidence when evaluating scientific credibility (Fiske & Dupree, 2014; van der Bles et al., 2019). Rather than eroding confidence, expressions of humility can strengthen perceptions of scientists’ methodological rigor and transparency—two central dimensions of trust.\\nThe intervention consists of a short, two-minute text designed to highlight epistemic humility in science and aims to acknowledge ongoing learning in the field. Participants will read a headline such as: “Why good scientists never claim to have the final word” followed by a body of text for the article such as: “Science moves forward by testing, refining, and sometimes revising what we know. When climate scientists say that their understanding has changed—perhaps updating how fast the ice will melt or how much temperatures might rise—that’s not a failure. It’s how reliable knowledge grows. Good science says: here’s what we do know (e.g., humans are warming the planet), and here’s what we are still exploring (e.g., exact slopes and timelines). Generally, scientists are open about the limits of their knowledge but are committed to refining it as new data emerges. That clarity and willingness to say ‘we don’t fully know yet’ signals transparency, honesty, and competence—rather than hiding messy unknowns. So next time you hear or read about uncertainty or changing predictions, remember: it means the science is working, not failing.”\\nThis approach is particularly relevant in an era of rapidly evolving climate findings, where changing projections can be misrepresented as evidence of deception or political bias. By normalizing epistemic humility as one tone of credible science, this brief text intervention helps recalibrate public expectations: trustworthy science isn’t unchanging—it’s self-correcting. By embedding epistemic humility into how scientific communication is framed, it offers a realistic, psychologically informed path toward restoring and sustaining trust in climate scientists.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Why Good Scientists Never Claim to Have the Final Word\\n\\nScience moves forward by testing, refining, and sometimes revising what we know. It’s not a sign of weakness when scientists update their conclusions—it’s a sign that the process is working. When climate scientists say that their understanding has changed—perhaps updating how fast the ice will melt or how much temperatures might rise—that’s not a failure. It’s how reliable knowledge grows.\\n\\nYou’ve probably seen the pattern before: a bold headline claims “scientists predict dramatic sea-level rise by 2050,” followed months later by a quieter update that the timeline has shifted. For some, these changes sound like “backtracking.” But in reality, they show the difference between speculation and self-correction. Science is built to evolve as new data sharpen the picture. When the underlying evidence improves, so should the conclusions.\\n\\nGood science says: here’s what we do know (for instance, humans are warming the planet), and here’s what we are still exploring (such as exactly how fast or where the effects will appear). A trustworthy scientist doesn’t pretend to know it all. Instead, they make judgments based on the best available evidence—and they make clear what remains uncertain. That openness isn’t hesitation; it’s intellectual honesty. It tells us the scientist is aware of limits and willing to update their thinking if the data demand it.\\n\\nSo next time you hear or read about changing predictions, remember: it doesn’t mean scientists were wrong to begin with. It means they were honest enough to revise their views when better information arrived. The willingness to say “we don’t fully know yet” is not the opposite of expertise—it’s proof of it.

Climate change has become highly politicized and polarized in public discourse. At the same time, debates continue within scientific communities about scientists’ appropriate roles in society, particularly regarding advocacy and objectivity. While some maintain that science communication should remain “neutral” and value-free, scholars in philosophy of science argue that social, political, and ethical values inevitably shape how research is conducted and shared. The issue, therefore, is not whether values are present, but how they are communicated. \\n\\nRecent work suggests that when scientists explicitly disclose the values that guide their research, it may foster transparency and allow audiences to evaluate scientific claims more thoughtfully (van Eck et al., 2024). However, empirical findings remain mixed. Some studies indicate that value disclosures can undermine credibility when scientists’ values appear political or misaligned with the audience (Elliot, 2022). In contrast, other research finds that communicating scientists' care for public health can increase perceived trustworthiness (Hicks & Lobato, 2022). This indicates a need to clarify which kinds of value disclosures are most effective. \\n\\nThis intervention tests whether disclosing widely shared prosocial values, such as prioritizing social safety and protecting public health, increases trust in climate scientists. Participants will read a short statement from an interview with a “typical climate scientist.” In the experimental condition, the scientist communicates both their research findings and the values that motivate their work. In the control condition, the scientist communicates the same scientific information without stating personal values. \\n\\nIf value disclosure is effective, we expect increases primarily in perceived integrity, benevolence, and openness, dimensions shown to underpin trust in science. The intervention is highly applicable to real-world science communication settings such as public talks, interviews, and institutional messaging, where small adjustments in messaging may positively affect public trust. This study contributes to ongoing research investigating how transparent, prosocial value communication may help sustain trust in science.\\n\\n  \\nReferences\\nElliott, Kevin C., Aaron M.

Ideological divides further fuel distrust by framing the issue as “us” versus “them” (2) with each side perceived to hold opposing values (3). Consequently, interventions that merely aim to reduce psychological distance between groups (4) or rely on static social norms have had limited success (5). \\n\\nOur intervention takes a novel approach to enhancing trust in climate scientists by integrating theories of dynamic norms (6) and in-group favouritism (2). It reshapes perceptions of climate scientists’ moral values as centred on families, communities, and the economy. Dynamic norms operate by highlighting how public attitudes evolve over time, triggering two cognitive processes: (a) anticipating a future where such values are integral to the climate change agenda and (b) reconsidering past value-based barriers to change. Aligning climate scientists’ values with those of the in-group alleviates intergroup threat and helps to dissolve perceived divides (7).  \\n\\nWhy the intervention is effective \\nOur intervention is effective because it frames climate scientists as politically and morally aligned with the in-group. Prior studies (8,9) shows that such alignment reduces intergroup barriers and fosters more favourable climate attitudes.

A perceived political liberal bias can partly explain this lower level of trust in climate scientists among conservatives, as climate scientists are perceived as among the most liberal scientists (Altenmüller et al., 2024).\\n\\nImportantly, conservatives do not show equally low trust toward all scientists. Recent evidence from the US suggests that conservatives report the highest levels of trust in mathematicians, zoologists, and marine biologists (Gligorić et al., 2025), likely because scientists in these fields are perceived as being more politically moderate (Altenmüller et al., 2024).\\n\\nBuilding on this research, the proposed intervention aims to test whether trust in scientists from other fields can be leveraged to boost trust in climate scientists. Specifically, it focuses on the higher levels of trust conservatives express toward certain types of scientists. Participants will be exposed to information on interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and scientists from fields typically more trusted by conservatives, including mathematicians, zoologists, and marine biologists. The intervention will be a short text. \\n\\nWhile the intervention primarily targets conservative participants, it is very likely that it also will lead to higher trust among liberal participants, given that liberals tend to report high levels of trust in scientists across all fields (Gligorić et al., 2025). However, the way in which the intervention might strengthen trust in climate scientists may differ between conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nFor conservatives, the intervention could reduce the perception that climate scientists belong to a political outgroup (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), as the interdisciplinary collaborations highlight scientists who are not only part of the perceived outgroup but may also belong to, or align with, the ingroup. For liberals, on the other hand, who often prioritize climate issues very highly (e.g., Cole et al., 2025), learning that climate scientists collaborate with researchers from other fields (demonstrating commitment to addressing the climate crisis) is likely to further increase their trust in climate scientists.\\n\\nI believe that if this intervention proves effective, it could have practical applications. It could, for instance, increase motivation to communicate more actively about the interdisciplinary research currently being conducted in relation to climate science.

Yet, despite such visible consequences, research continues to identify strong patterns of motivated skepticism and distrust toward climate scientists, particularly among conservatives. Conservative individuals tend to be skeptical toward the existence of climate change (Egan & Mullin, 2017), the policies proposed to address it (Campbell & Kay, 2014), and the scientists researching it (Druckman et al., 2024). Some scholars even propose conservatives as the primary target group for decreasing distrust toward climate scientists (Remsö et al., 2025).\\nA promising approach to counter such motivated skepticism stems from construal level theory, which posits that individuals think about events or objects at varying levels of abstraction (Keller et al., 2022). When people perceive an issue as psychologically distant – spatially, temporally, socially, or hypothetically – they tend to engage in more abstract reasoning, often reinforcing prior ideological beliefs. Conversely, decreasing psychological distance has been shown to foster engagement and reduce defensive reasoning. Recent research demonstrates that informing individuals about the proximate, personally relevant risks of climate change can bridge partisan divides and strengthen belief in climate-related facts (Chu & Yang, 2018; Jones et al., 2017; Vlasceanu et al., 2024).\\nBuilding on these findings, we propose an intervention that makes both climate change and the work of climate scientists psychologically proximate. The treatment will present narratives that showcase how scientists’ efforts directly protect individuals and communities from immediate threats – for instance, through early-warning systems for floods, wildfire-risk modeling, or blizzard forecasting. By mapping participants’ demographic information, most importantly their state of residence, we can tailor the scenario to a locally salient hazard. Participants from flood-prone areas might read about scientists whose forecasts saved families from flash floods, those in fire-prone regions might encounter scientists preventing catastrophic wildfires, while respondents in colder climates could read about forecasters who helped cities prepare for deadly blizzards.\\nWe predict that reducing psychological distance in this locally adapted way will diminish motivated skepticism and increase trust in climate scientists. Two core trust dimensions should be particularly affected. First, portraying scientists as preventing risks for individuals should enhance perceived Benevolence – showing them as considerate, caring, and motivated to improve others’ wellbeing. Second, demonstrating the proximate usefulness of their work should heighten perceived Integrity, signaling honesty, ethicality, and sincerity. Together, these shifts are expected to foster higher overall trust and reduce ideological polarization in perceptions of scientists’ credibility.\\nWhile proximizing risk has proven effective for climate-belief interventions (Vlasceanu, 2024), extending this logic to strengthen trust in climate scientists themselves remains a novel approach. Its real-world applicability is substantial: localized media coverage or public communication that portrays scientists as guardians against immediate, everyday threats could uniquely humanize them and rebuild public trust in climate science. Even in a media landscape saturated with stories of climate impacts, highlighting scientists’ concrete and benevolent actions – “saviors of children in summer camps” – might humanize them and bridge divides in public trust.\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"font-weight\":\"600\",\"margin-top\":\"10px\",\"color\":\"#333\",\"font-size\":\"0.95rem\"}},\"children\":[\"Stimulus\"]},{\"name\":\"pre\",\"attribs\":{\"style\":{\"margin-left\":\"12px\",\"margin-top\":\"2px\",\"margin-bottom\":\"10px\",\"white-space\":\"pre-wrap\",\"word-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"overflow-wrap\":\"break-word\",\"font-size\":\"0.9rem\"}},\"children\":[\"I.

After reading, you will be asked to answer a few short questions in your own words.\\n\\nIntervention page 2\\n\\nCase 1\\nPredicting Floods Before They Strike\\nIn many parts of the United States, floods have become a very real and nearby threat. Heavy rainstorms that used to happen only every few decades now strike several times a year. Across states such as Texas, Kentucky, and Arizona, flash floods have swept through roads, homes, and schools with little or no warning. For many families, flooding is no longer something that happens “somewhere else” – it happens close to home.\\nTo help communities prepare, researchers at the University of Arizona’s Center for Applied Hydroclimate Sciences have created a new early-warning system that can predict extreme rainfall and flooding weeks in advance. Using satellite data, ocean temperatures, and atmospheric-circulation models, they identify patterns that signal when dangerous storms are likely to form. Their model has already helped emergency managers in the Southwest issue warnings earlier and take action to protect residents and infrastructure.\\nLead researcher Dr Hsin-I Chang explains that the team aims to provide earlier detection of extreme weather events so that people and local governments have more time to act. The same approach that first helped predict the devastating 2015 Texas floods is now being adapted for other regions, including Arizona and parts of the U.S. Midwest.\\nThanks to this work, scientists are helping prevent floods from becoming full-scale disasters – turning climate research into protection that can make a difference for communities this season and in the years ahead.\\n(Based on Littin, S. (2025, July 31). “Early Warning: Climate Model Predicts Extreme Rain and Floods Weeks in Advance.” Arizona Institute for Resilience. https://air.arizona.edu/news/early-warning-climate-model-predicts-extreme-rain-and-floods-weeks-advance)\\n\\nCase 2\\nDetecting Wildfires Before They Spread\\nIn many parts of the United States, wildfires have become a very real and nearby threat. Fire seasons that once lasted a few weeks now stretch across several months, and even regions that rarely burned before are now facing fast-moving blazes. Smoke and ash can travel hundreds of miles, turning skies orange and threatening people’s health far from the flames. For many families, wildfires are no longer something that happen “somewhere else” – they happen close to home.\\nTo help communities prepare, scientists from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and NASA are developing new early-detection systems that can spot wildfires minutes after they begin. Using satellite images, heat sensors, and artificial-intelligence models, these systems detect the first signs of smoke or fire and alert local emergency managers right away. Their work has already helped firefighters in several western states reach ignition sites faster and prevent small blazes from becoming major disasters.\\nResearchers are also improving forecasts that show where and when dangerous fire conditions are likely to develop. This gives park rangers, energy companies, and residents more time to clear vegetation, secure equipment, or plan evacuations before a fire starts.\\nThanks to this work, scientists are helping prevent wildfires from becoming full-scale disasters – turning climate research into protection that can make a difference for communities this season and in the years ahead.\\n(Based on DHS Science & Technology Directorate, “Technology to Reduce the Impacts of Wildfires,” 2025. https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-108161.)\\n\\nCase 3\\nForecasting Winter Storms Before They Strike\\nIn many parts of the United States, severe winter storms have become a very real and nearby threat. Heavy snowfall, freezing rain, and sudden cold snaps have caused power outages, road closures, and even loss of life. Events like the 2021 Texas freeze and the 2022 Buffalo blizzard showed that dangerous winter weather can strike almost anywhere. For many families, these storms are no longer distant events – they happen close to home.\\nTo help communities prepare, scientists at the National Weather Service and several U.S. universities are developing new forecasting systems that can predict blizzards and extreme cold days to weeks in advance. Using satellite data, radar observations, and high-resolution climate models, they identify patterns in the atmosphere that signal when and where dangerous storms are likely to form. Their work has already helped local authorities issue warnings earlier and protect residents and infrastructure before conditions worsen.\\nResearchers are also working with city planners and emergency agencies to translate forecasts into concrete actions – salting roads, securing power lines, or warning schools and hospitals in time to prepare.\\nThanks to this work, scientists are helping prevent winter storms from becoming full-scale disasters – turning climate research into protection that can make a difference for communities this season and in the years ahead.\\n(Based on Novak, D.R.

We believe this is because distrust in climate scientists stems from deep “attitude roots” – psychological foundations such as perceived vested interests, ideological bias, and elite manipulation (3) that shape key dimensions of trust: competence, integrity, and benevolence (4). Until now, we’ve lacked tools to identify and directly address these roots.\\n\\nIn previous work, we already showed that Generative AI can reduce misinformation about electric vehicles (5) and climate skepticism (6). However, these approaches relied on static or poorly structured prompts, limiting adaptability – especially within a 5-minute intervention.\\n\\nWe propose a novel AI-based intervention using dynamic prompting to (a) diagnose the specific attitude root underlying a participant’s distrust of climate scientists, and (b) engage them in a brief, tailored conversation aimed at challenging that root.\\n\\n\\nWhy the intervention is effective\\nParticipants interact with a chat window embedded in their Qualtrics survey. Because we neither assume distrust nor wish to steer participants toward a specific root, the AI begins with an open prompt:\\n\\n“I’d like to understand your views on climate scientists. When you hear them talk about climate change, do you doubt them? If so, why?”\\n\\nBased on the response, the AI identifies the relevant attitude root and initiates a polite but confrontational evidence-based exchange.\\n\\nWe adopt a confrontational tone rather than the empathetic style typical of science communication. Brief, assertive public health campaigns have proven highly effective with limited attention spans, creating a cognitive disruption that bypasses defensiveness and prompts reflection (7).\\n\\nWe already implemented the base paradigm for your convenience, so you can see it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTy0xGXiy8c. Technical integration is straightforward; our team can assist as needed. All LLM (API) costs will be covered by our institution, and existing ethics approval for AI conversations can serve as a precedent for your review process.\\n\\nHow it could be applied in real-world settings\\nThe intervention is deployable through digital platforms – such as public information websites, social media, or museum kiosks – engaging users in short, personalised conversations about climate science. Its scalable, automated design enables wide-reaching, cost-effective applications in public communication, education, and policy outreach.\\n\\n\\n1.\\tChan, M.-P. S. & Albarracín, D. (2023).
