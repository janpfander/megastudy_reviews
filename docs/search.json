This is problematic for the follow-up study: we will likely not have persistent effects from fictional interventions, or worse, we might even find negative long-term effects if participants felt we were just making things up.\n\nDiversity\n\nIdeally, we want to test a wide range of different interventions. With similar interventions, we used two strategies to avoid redundancy: When there were complementary elements, we suggested merging (and we will offer co-authorship to all involved teams). When two interventions were essentially the same, we picked the one that was better ranked.\n\nMajor concerns on effectiveness\n\nWe suggest excluding one intervention, because we believe it is too unrelated to our outcome variable, trust in climate scientists. In another case, we justified exclusions with major concerns stated in one of the reviewer comments (but in this case, in addition, a similar and higher-ranked intervention was already included)."
